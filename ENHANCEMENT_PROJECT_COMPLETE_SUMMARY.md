## How To Use Everything

### Before Every Deployment

```bash
# 1. Run pre-deployment validator
cd "/home/dave/Local Sites/rundaverun-local/app/public"
/home/dave/skippy/scripts/wordpress/pre_deployment_validator_v1.0.0.sh

# 2. Check result
# - 🔴 BLOCKED? Fix errors and re-run
# - 🟡 NOT RECOMMENDED? Fix high-priority errors
# - 🟢 APPROVED? Safe to deploy!

# 3. Deploy (your existing process)
# ...

# 4. Run post-deployment verification
/home/dave/skippy/scripts/wordpress/deployment_verification_v1.0.0.sh

# 5. Confirm deployment success
# Check that validation passed
```

### Weekly Security Check

```bash
# Run security scanner (or wait for cron)
/home/dave/skippy/scripts/security/vulnerability_scanner_v1.0.0.sh

# Review report
ls -lht /home/dave/skippy/conversations/security_reports/ | head -1
```

### Monthly Backup Verification

```bash
# Run backup tester (or wait for cron)
/home/dave/skippy/scripts/backup/backup_verification_test_v1.0.0.sh

# Review report
ls -lht /home/dave/skippy/conversations/backup_reports/ | head -1
```

### Finding Scripts

```bash
# View script index
cat /home/dave/skippy/SCRIPT_INDEX.md

# Search for scripts
grep -i "keyword" /home/dave/skippy/SCRIPT_INDEX.md

# By category
grep "Category: wordpress" /home/dave/skippy/SCRIPT_INDEX.md
```

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add these lines:

```cron
