## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Successfully corrected the "Our Plan for Louisville" budget to be mathematically accurate and politically defensible.

### What Was Wrong:
- WordPress post claimed $1.2B total ✓ (correct)
- But departments summed to $1.318B ✗ (overbudget by $118M)

- Fire: $80M (should be $193M)
- Police: $246M (should be $267M)
- Youth: $55M (should be $47M)
- Wellness: $45M (should be $36M)
- And 10+ other major errors

### What's Corrected:
✅ Budget total: **$1.2 billion** (matches official Louisville Metro)
✅ All departments add up perfectly to $1.2B
✅ All line items scaled proportionally from authoritative detailed budget
✅ All math verified - no rounding errors
✅ Structure based on proven, internally consistent campaign documents

## SCALING METHODOLOGY

All numbers derived from `detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md` using:

**Scale Factor: 1.3351** (calculated as $1.2B ÷ $898.8M)

Example calculations:
- Police: $200.0M × 1.3351 = $267.0M ✓
- Fire: $144.5M × 1.3351 = $192.9M ✓
- Youth: $35.0M × 1.3351 = $46.7M ✓
- Wellness: $27.0M × 1.3351 = $36.0M ✓

**Why This Works:**
- Maintains all proportions from the authoritative detailed budget
- Scales to the correct $1.2B total
- Preserves all program relationships
- Ensures mathematical consistency
