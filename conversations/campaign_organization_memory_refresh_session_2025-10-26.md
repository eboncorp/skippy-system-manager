## 4. INVESTIGATION/ANALYSIS PROCESS

### Step 1: Initial System State Check (00:32)

**Background Processes Detected:**
```bash
# Process 1: create_claude_upload_package.sh (running)
# Process 2: full_home_backup.sh (running)
```

**Commands Executed:**
```bash
bash ~/Config/authorize_claude
# Granted 4-hour autonomous permissions
```

### Step 2: Network Diagnostics (Resolved Earlier)

**Issue:** SSL certificate error on WiFi (NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID)

**Investigation:**
1. Checked certificate issuer on both hotspot and WiFi
2. Found same Let's Encrypt certificate on both networks
3. Identified browser certificate database corruption
4. Browser cert database dated August 12, 2023 (outdated)

**Root Cause:** Browser certificate database corruption, NOT router SSL inspection

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Created fix_browser_certs.sh
# Closed browsers and reset ~/.pki/nssdb/cert9.db
```

**Result:** ✅ User confirmed "its working"

### Step 3: Claude.ai Upload Package Research

**Research Questions:**
1. What file types does Claude.ai Projects support?
2. How to optimize 192MB campaign directory for upload?
3. What's the file size limit?

**Findings:**
- Supported: PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, MD, images, audio
- 30MB per file limit
- ~200K token context window
- NOT supported: ZIP files

**Actions Taken:**
1. Scanned campaign directory (192MB total, 75MB in directory)
2. Extracted valuable content from ZIP files
3. Removed unsupported file types
4. Created optimized package

**Final Package:**
- Location: `/home/dave/Documents/Government/budgets/RunDaveRun/campaign/CLAUDE_UPLOAD_FINAL/`
- Files: 180 (144 .md, 13 .html, 17 .txt, 1 .css)
- Size: 3.5MB
- ZIP files: 0 (all removed after user reported upload rejection)

### Step 4: Backup Verification

**Backup Script Analysis:**
```bash
# Script: ~/Scripts/full_home_backup.sh
# Remote: googledrive:Backups/ebonhawk-full
# Schedule: Daily at 3:00 AM via cron
# Retention: 30 days
```

**Directories Backed Up:**
- Critical: Documents, Scripts, Config, .ssh, Skippy, .nexus
- Standard: Desktop, Downloads, Pictures, Utilities, Scans
- Large: Videos, Music, .cache

**Enhancement Added:**
Added log cleanup feature (lines 196-209):
```bash
# Clean up old log files (older than $RETENTION_DAYS days)
find "$LOG_DIR" -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +$RETENTION_DAYS -print0 | \
while IFS= read -r -d '' OLD_LOG; do
    log_message "  Removing old log: $(basename $OLD_LOG)"
    rm -f "$OLD_LOG"
    ((LOGS_REMOVED++))
done
```

**Manual Backup Triggered:**
```bash
~/Scripts/full_home_backup.sh &
