# Deployment Checklist Protocol

**Date Created**: 2025-10-28
**Purpose**: Step-by-step deployment procedures with verification
**Applies To**: All deployments (WordPress, scripts, packages)
**Priority**: HIGH (prevents deployment failures)

## Overview

This protocol provides comprehensive checklists for deploying changes from local/development to staging/production environments. Following these steps prevents common deployment issues and ensures rollback capability.

## Deployment Types

### 1. WordPress Site Deployment
### 2. Script Deployment
### 3. Package/Release Deployment
### 4. Configuration Changes
### 5. Emergency/Hotfix Deployment
