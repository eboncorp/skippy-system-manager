# COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET DOCUMENT AUDIT & UPDATES
**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Session:** Continuation from line-item budget search
**Purpose:** Compare all campaign documents, update outdated files, ensure consistency

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Task Completed:** Comprehensive audit of all campaign budget documents across multiple directories to identify files with outdated budget figures and unique content requiring updates.

**Key Finding:** Most files in the plugin directory (dave-biggers-policy-manager/assets/markdown-files/) are current with $1.2 billion budget. One volunteer-only document required updating.

**Result:** ‚úÖ All critical documents now have correct $1.2 billion budget figures

---

## METHODOLOGY

### 1. Comprehensive File Scan

Scanned three primary locations:
- **Campaign Root:** 114 markdown files
- **Plugin Directory:** 53 markdown files (authoritative source)
- **Budget 3.0 Directory:** 8 markdown files (legacy/outdated)

### 2. Budget Number Detection

Searched for three budget versions:
- ‚ùå **$898.8 million** - Very outdated (Budget 3.0 era)
- ‚ùå **$1.025 billion** - Outdated (early campaign)
- ‚úÖ **$1.2 billion** - Current (official campaign budget)

### 3. Comparison Analysis

For each file with outdated numbers:
- Checked if equivalent exists in plugin directory
- Compared file sizes and line counts
- Identified significant differences requiring review
- Determined if content is public, volunteer-only, or internal

---

## AUDIT RESULTS

### Campaign Root Directory (114 files)

**Budget Number Distribution:**
- ‚ùå Outdated budget numbers: 37 files
- ‚úÖ Current budget numbers: 13 files
- ‚ö™ No budget numbers: 64 files

**Key Finding:** Many files with outdated numbers in campaign root already have CURRENT equivalents in the plugin directory that are more comprehensive.

### Files Requiring Manual Review

The comparison script identified **12 files** needing manual review:

#### PUBLIC DOCUMENTS:
1. ‚úÖ **CAMPAIGN_ONE_PAGER.md**
   - Campaign root: 286 lines, $1.025B (outdated)
   - Plugin equivalent: CAMPAIGN_ONE_PAGER_v3.md, 309 lines, $1.2B ‚úÖ
   - **Decision:** Plugin version is superior (includes employee pay section, better formatting)
   - **Action:** None needed - plugin version already uploaded to WordPress

2. **BUDGET_3.0_PUBLISHED_SUMMARY.md**
   - Campaign root only: 230 lines
   - **Content:** Internal documentation of what was published on Oct 13
   - **Status:** Internal/administrative document
   - **Action:** None needed - not a public document

#### VOLUNTEER-ONLY DOCUMENTS:
3. ‚úÖ **UNION_ENGAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md**
   - Plugin version: 655 lines, $898.8M (OUTDATED)
   - **Issue:** Referenced "$898.8M - can't increase" on line 626
   - **Action Taken:** ‚úÖ Updated to "$1.2B - same as current approved budget, can't increase"
   - **Version:** Updated from 2.0.1 to 3.0, dated October 19, 2025

#### INTERNAL/STRATEGY DOCUMENTS (No Action Needed):
4-12. The following are internal administrative documents that don't need public updates:
   - ORIGIN_OF_1.27B_NUMBER.md (internal budget calculation notes)
   - CAMPAIGN_DIRECTORY_REVIEW.md (internal file organization)
   - comprehensive_wordpress_package_review.md (internal technical review)
   - START_HERE_DAVE.md (internal guide)
   - PROOFREADING_REPORT.md (internal proofreading notes - also outdated per our scan)
   - BUDGET_CONFIRMATION.md (internal confirmation)
   - COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (internal completion notes)
   - PACKAGE_CONTENT_COMPARISON.md (internal package comparison)
   - OPPOSITION_ATTACK_RESPONSES.md (strategy document - minor differences)

2. Detect budget numbers using regex patterns
3. Compare file sizes and line counts
4. Identify files with significant differences
5. Classify as PUBLIC, VOLUNTEER-ONLY, or INTERNAL
