## 2. CONTEXT

### Previous Work Referenced
The session continued from previous work where:

- Multiple optimization packages had been reviewed (COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md, CSS_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md, WORDPRESS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
- Website structure included 6 main pages: Home, About Dave, Our Plan, Get Involved, Contact, Policy Library

### Initial State
- Homepage: Had new "Public Safety" card (completed in previous session)
- Our Plan page: Still had separate "46 Mini Police Substations" section
- No dedicated Glossary page existed
- Contact page had standard messaging

### User's Problem
User wanted consistency between Homepage and Our Plan page, plus a comprehensive resource for voters to understand budget terminology.

---

## 3. USER REQUEST

### Original Request (Verbatim)
**First Request:** "ok. [after completing Public Safety card on homepage]"
**Follow-up:** "i would like to add page between policy library page and get involved page, dedicated entirely to the glossary."

### Task Objectives
1. Update Our Plan page to match new Public Safety structure from Homepage
2. Create comprehensive Glossary page with all budget terms from BUDGET_GLOSSARY.md
3. Position Glossary between Policy Library and Get Involved in navigation
4. Make glossary comprehensive with all missing sections
5. Update Contact page with "What school did you go to?" question
6. Verify all pages are live

### Expected Deliverables

## 4. INVESTIGATION/ANALYSIS PROCESS

### Step 1: Understanding Public Safety Programs
**File Read:** `/home/dave/Documents/Government/budgets/RunDaveRun/campaign/dave-biggers-policy-manager/assets/markdown-files/MINI_SUBSTATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Mini Substations: 46 total locations, $650K each annually, $77.4M total
- Deployment over 4 years (12, 12, 12, 10 per year)
- 6 officers per station rotating shifts
- 5,000 square feet each
- Community policing model with foot patrols

**Search for Community Detectives:**
```bash
grep -r "community detective" --include="*.md" -i
```

**Discovery:**
- Community Detectives are SEPARATE program from Mini Substations
- 12 detectives total (2 per district)
- $3.6 million investment
- Focused on prevention and local crime solving
- NOT assigned to mini substations

**Retrieved:** Page ID 107 content via WordPress REST API

**Current Structure Found:**
- Separate section for "46 Mini Police Substations"
- Did not include Community Detectives
- Investment: $77.4M listed
- Needed consolidation to match Homepage

### Step 3: Glossary Content Analysis
**File Read:** `BUDGET_GLOSSARY.md` (406 lines)

**Sections Available:**
- Budget Basics (9 terms)
- Revenue Terms (6 terms)
- Spending Categories (6 terms)
