## CONTEXT

This session continued from a previous conversation about the Dave Biggers mayoral campaign website. The user had previously:
- Set up WordPress site at http://rundaverun-local.local/
- Implemented enhanced design system
- Updated the About Dave page with 2018 campaign links
- Imported 19 policy documents

## USER REQUEST

User stated: "budget3.1 should be unpublished, its internal workings of the budget creation, but i dont see 1. budget3_0_REVISED.txt ‚Äì Core budget document ($1.2B, realistic numbers) 2. budget3_appendix_detailed_lineitem.txt ‚Äì Detailed breakdown by department"

**Task:**
1. Unpublish Budget 3.1 (internal document)
2. Find and publish Budget 3.0 documents with correct $1.2B budget
3. Locate the missing budget3_0_REVISED.txt and budget3_appendix_detailed_lineitem.txt files

---

## INVESTIGATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Search for Budget 3.0 Files
Searched the entire campaign directory for files matching:
- `budget3_0_REVISED.txt`
- `budget3_appendix_detailed_lineitem.txt`
- Budget 3.0 related documents
- Files with $1.2B budget amount

### Step 2: Document Discovery
Found references to these files in internal documentation:
- `SOURCE_FILE_REFERENCE_GUIDE.txt` mentioned both files
- `BUDGET_3.1_COMPREHENSIVE_PACKAGE_PLAN.txt` referenced them as source files
- Files were described as being in "Budget3.1_text.zip" archive

### Step 3: Actual File Locations
The actual Budget 3.0 documents were found with different names:
- **`BUDGET_SUMMARY_v3_from_BIGGERS_CAMPAIGN_FINAL_v3.md`** (the core budget document)
- **`OUR_PLAN_FOR_LOUISVILLE_from_BIGGERS_CAMPAIGN_FINAL_v3.md`** (the detailed breakdown)

Both files located in:
`/home/dave/Local Sites/rundaverun-local/app/public/wp-content/plugins/dave-biggers-policy-manager/assets/markdown-files/`

### Step 4: Budget Amount Verification
Verified both files contain correct $1.2 billion budget:
- Executive summary shows: "Total Budget: $1.2 billion"
- Detailed plan shows: "Total Budget: $1.2 billion (Same as current approved budget)"

### Step 5: Found Outdated Files
Also discovered outdated Budget 3.0 RESTRUCTURED files in:
`/home/dave/Documents/Government/budgets/RunDaveRun/Budget3.0/`
- These showed $898.8M (incorrect/old)
- Were NOT the files being sought

## KEY INSIGHTS

### File Naming Discovery
The files `budget3_0_REVISED.txt` and `budget3_appendix_detailed_lineitem.txt` mentioned in internal documentation do not exist with those exact names. They were renamed during the v3 packaging process to:
- `BUDGET_SUMMARY_v3_from_BIGGERS_CAMPAIGN_FINAL_v3.md`
- `OUR_PLAN_FOR_LOUISVILLE_from_BIGGERS_CAMPAIGN_FINAL_v3.md`

The content is identical to what was described - they are the Budget 3.0 documents with $1.2B budget.

### Outdated Files Identified
Files in `/Budget3.0/` directory with "RESTRUCTURED" in name show old $898.8M budget and should not be used.

### Title Improvements
Changed from technical filenames to user-friendly titles:
- Old: "BUDGET_SUMMARY_v3_from_BIGGERS_CAMPAIGN_FINAL_v3"
- New: "Budget 3.0: Executive Budget Summary ($1.2B)"

This improves:
- SEO (search engine optimization)
- User comprehension
- Professional appearance
- Social media sharing

## USER INTERACTION

**User Request 1:** "search /home/dave/Documents/Government/budgets/RunDaveRun/campaign for the documents"
**Response:** Conducted comprehensive search, found actual files with different names

**User Request 2:** "yes, and rename them if needed."
**Response:** Published documents with cleaner, professional titles that are SEO-friendly and voter-accessible

**User Request 3:** "ok. create a transcript then save it to /home/dave/Skippy/conversations"
**Response:** Created this comprehensive transcript

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **File Naming Evolution:** Documentation may reference old file names after files are renamed during packaging
2. **Version Management:** Budget 3.0 vs 3.1 distinction is important - 3.1 was internal process, 3.0 is public result
3. **Character Encoding:** WordPress/MySQL may not support full UTF-8 emoji range, need to clean special characters
4. **Title Optimization:** Technical filenames should be converted to user-friendly titles for publication
5. **Budget Verification:** Always verify dollar amounts match - multiple old versions exist with wrong figures
