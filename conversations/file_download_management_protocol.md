# File Download Management Protocol

**Date Created**: 2025-10-28
**Purpose**: Automatic detection and processing of downloaded files
**Applies To**: All files downloaded to `/home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/`
**Priority**: MEDIUM (convenience and efficiency)

## Overview

This protocol establishes automated workflows for handling files downloaded to the Claude downloads folder. When Claude Code is running and a new file appears in the downloads folder, Claude should automatically detect, read, and process it according to file type.

---

## Downloads Directory

**Primary Location**: `/home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/`

**Purpose**: Staging area for files downloaded from web browsers, email, or other sources that need Claude's analysis or processing.

---

## Automatic Detection

### When User Mentions Downloads

When the user says phrases like:
- "I just downloaded a file"
- "Check the downloads folder"
- "I have a new file"
- "Look at what I downloaded"

**Claude should automatically**:
1. Check `/home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/` for most recent file
2. Identify the newest file by modification time
3. Read and analyze the file
4. Provide appropriate response based on file type

### Proactive Checking

If user says "watch downloads" or "monitor downloads":
- Periodically check for new files (every 30-60 seconds)
- Alert when new file detected
- Automatically process new files

---

## File Type Handling

### Text Files (.txt, .md, .log)

**Action**:
1. Read the file contents
2. Provide summary of what's in the file
3. Ask what user wants to do with it
   - Move to organized location?
   - Extract information?
   - Process/transform?

**Example**:
```
Found: protocol_notes.txt (5KB, just now)
Contents: Notes about WordPress deployment procedures

Suggested actions:
- Add to existing protocol?
- Create new protocol?
- File in conversations/?
```

---

### ZIP/Archive Files (.zip, .tar.gz, .7z)

**Action**:
1. List archive contents
2. Show file count and total size
3. Ask if user wants to extract
4. Suggest extraction location based on content

**Example**:
```
Found: project_files.zip (2.5MB, just now)
Contents: 15 files
- 8 PHP files
- 4 CSS files
- 3 JS files

Extract to:
- /home/dave/rundaverun/campaign/ (WordPress files detected)

---

## Workflow After Detection

### Step 1: Identify File
```bash
ls -lt /home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/ | head -5
```

### Step 2: Read/Analyze
Based on file type, use appropriate tool:
- Read tool for text/code
- Read tool for images/PDFs (visual analysis)
- Bash with unzip -l for archives
- File command for unknown types

### Step 3: Present Options

Always provide 3-4 actionable options:
1. **Organize**: Where to move/rename the file
2. **Process**: What to do with the contents
3. **Keep**: Leave in downloads for now
4. **Delete**: If not needed

### Step 4: Execute User Choice

After user decides, execute the action:
- Move files with proper naming
- Extract archives to appropriate locations
- Process data as requested
- Clean up downloads folder

---

## Naming Convention for Downloaded Files

### When Moving from Downloads

Apply standard naming convention:
- **Before**: `Screenshot from 2025-10-28 03-15-42.png`
- **After**: `screenshot_2025-10-28_031542_wordpress_error.png`

**Rules**:
- Lowercase with underscores
- Keep date if useful (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Add descriptive suffix
- Remove spaces and special characters

---

## Organization Locations

### Common Destinations

**Scripts**:
‚Üí `/home/dave/skippy/scripts/[category]/`

**Documentation**:
‚Üí `/home/dave/skippy/conversations/`

**WordPress Files**:
‚Üí `/home/dave/rundaverun/campaign/`

**Screenshots**:
‚Üí `/home/dave/Pictures/Screenshots/` (if important)
‚Üí Delete if temporary

**Data Files**:
‚Üí `/home/dave/skippy/data/` or relevant project folder

**Temporary/Review**:
‚Üí Keep in downloads temporarily
‚Üí Delete after processing

---

## Cleanup Policy

### When to Delete from Downloads

**Immediately after**:
- ‚úÖ File moved to permanent location
- ‚úÖ Contents extracted and archived
- ‚úÖ Information captured elsewhere

**Keep temporarily if**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to review further
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Waiting for user decision
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Part of multi-file download

**Delete weekly**:
- üóëÔ∏è Files older than 7 days
- üóëÔ∏è Duplicate downloads
- üóëÔ∏è Temporary test files

## User Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Silent Download
User downloads file without mentioning it.

**Claude should**:
- NOT automatically detect (no interruption)
- Wait for user to mention it
- Respond when user says "check downloads"

### Pattern 2: Announced Download
User says "I just downloaded X"

**Claude should**:
- Immediately check downloads folder
- Find newest file
- Read and analyze
- Present options

### Pattern 3: Monitoring Request
User says "watch for downloads"

**Claude should**:
- Acknowledge monitoring
- Check every 30-60 seconds
- Alert on new files
- Auto-process per this protocol

### Pattern 4: Batch Downloads
User downloads multiple files

**Claude should**:
- List all recent files (last 5-10 minutes)
- Offer to process each
- Ask if batch operation preferred
- Process efficiently

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Protocol Document

**User**: "I just downloaded a protocol document"

**Claude**:
```bash
ls -lt /home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/ | head -3
```

**Output**:
```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dave dave 15234 Oct 28 03:20 deployment_checklist_v2.md
```

**Claude Response**:
```
Found: deployment_checklist_v2.md (15KB, just downloaded)

Reading contents... This appears to be an updated deployment checklist
protocol with enhanced pre-deployment checks and GoDaddy-specific steps.

Suggested actions:
1. Update existing protocol: /home/dave/skippy/conversations/deployment_checklist_protocol.md
2. Save as new version: deployment_checklist_v2.0.md
3. Review differences first

## Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Always read and analyze files before suggesting actions
- ‚úÖ Apply security checks to code files
- ‚úÖ Use proper naming conventions when organizing
- ‚úÖ Offer 3-4 clear action options
- ‚úÖ Clean up downloads folder regularly
- ‚úÖ Apply relevant protocol standards

### Don'ts ‚ùå

- ‚ùå Don't automatically move files without user approval
- ‚ùå Don't delete files without confirmation
- ‚ùå Don't execute code from downloads without review
- ‚ùå Don't ignore security concerns
- ‚ùå Don't leave downloads folder cluttered

---

## Quick Reference

### Check Downloads Command
```bash
ls -lt /home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/ | head -10
```

### Read Most Recent File
```bash
# Get most recent filename
LATEST=$(ls -t /home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/ | head -1)
# Read it
cat "/home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/$LATEST"
```

### Common File Type Checks
```bash
file "/home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/filename"
```

### Archive Contents
```bash
unzip -l "/home/dave/skippy/claude/downloads/file.zip"
```

- User mentions downloading files
- User says "check downloads"
- User requests monitoring

**Integration**:
- Works with all existing protocols
- Enforces naming conventions
- Maintains organization standards
