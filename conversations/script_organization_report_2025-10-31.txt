All moved scripts now follow semantic versioning:
  - Original scripts: v1.0.0
  - Duplicate/newer versions: v2.0.0
  - Format: script_name_v1.0.0.{sh|py}

NAMING CONVENTION:
All scripts now use lowercase_with_underscores format.

=================================================================

ORGANIZATION BENEFITS:
✓ All scripts in single centralized location
✓ Clear categorization by purpose
✓ Semantic versioning applied
✓ Consistent naming convention
✓ Easy to find and reference
✓ Backups preserved in original locations
✓ Follows script_saving_protocol.md standards

=================================================================

NEXT STEPS:
1. Consider consolidating utility/ and Utility/ directories
2. Review legacy_system_managers/ for scripts that could be retired
3. Clean up empty project directories (optional)
4. Update any hardcoded script paths in other code
