# Session Transcript & History Protocol

**Date Created**: 2025-10-28
**Purpose**: Standardized session documentation and history management
**Applies To**: All significant work sessions
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH (documentation and knowledge retention)

## Overview

This protocol establishes standards for creating session transcripts and managing session history. Comprehensive session documentation enables knowledge retention, troubleshooting, and understanding of how problems were solved.

## When to Create Session Transcripts

### Always Create Transcript For

**Major Work Sessions**:
- ✅ Multi-hour sessions with significant accomplishments
- ✅ Complex problem-solving sessions
- ✅ System configuration or setup
- ✅ Major deployments
- ✅ Large feature implementations
- ✅ Troubleshooting complex issues

**Milestone Sessions**:
- ✅ Completing major features
- ✅ Fixing critical bugs
- ✅ System architecture changes
- ✅ Protocol implementations
- ✅ Infrastructure setup

**Learning/Documentation Sessions**:
- ✅ First-time setup of new tools
- ✅ Learning new workflows
- ✅ Exploring unfamiliar systems
- ✅ Creating documentation

### Consider Creating Transcript For

**Medium-Length Sessions**:
- Sessions with valuable troubleshooting steps
- Sessions solving unusual problems
- Sessions establishing new procedures
- Sessions with important discoveries

### Skip Transcript For

**Quick Sessions**:
- Simple file edits
- Quick fixes (< 15 minutes)
- Routine tasks
- Questions only (no implementation)

---

## Naming Convention

### Format
```
[topic]_session_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### Topic Guidelines

**Use clear, descriptive topics**:
- ✅ `wordpress_database_migration_session_2025-10-28.md`
- ✅ `mobile_menu_fix_session_2025-10-28.md`
- ✅ `protocol_system_implementation_session_2025-10-28.md`
- ❌ `session_2025-10-28.md` (too generic)
- ❌ `work_session.md` (no date, not descriptive)

**Topic Naming Patterns**:
- Feature implementation: `[feature]_implementation_session_`
- Bug fixes: `[bug]_fix_session_` or `[area]_troubleshooting_session_`
- Setup/configuration: `[tool]_setup_session_`
- Optimization: `[area]_optimization_session_`
- Deployment: `[what]_deployment_session_`
- Review/analysis: `[area]_review_session_`

### Examples of Good Names

**WordPress Work**:
- `wordpress_database_import_oct26_session_2025-10-26.md`
- `wordpress_roles_restoration_session_2025-10-19.md`
- `wordpress_optimization_debug_session_2025-10-26.md`

**Website Work**:
- `website_mobile_fixes_complete_session_2025-10-14.md`
- `homepage_fixes_and_enhancements_session_2025-10-15.md`
- `website_cleanup_and_comparison_session_2025-10-13.md`

**Development**:
- `github_cicd_rest_api_setup_session_2025-10-21.md`
- `mobile_popup_removal_troubleshooting_session_2025-10-21.md`
- `avery_label_printing_setup_session_2025-10-26.md`

**System/Organization**:
- `campaign_organization_memory_refresh_session_2025-10-26.md`
- `protocol_system_implementation_session_2025-10-28.md`
- `network_optimization_session_2025-08-11.md`

---

## File Location

### Primary Location
```
/home/dave/skippy/conversations/
```

**All session transcripts save here** for centralized access.

### Organization

**No subdirectories needed**:
- All transcripts in one directory
- Use descriptive filenames for organization
- Use `ls -lt` to see recent sessions
- Use `grep` to search across sessions

**Rationale**:
- Easy to find all sessions
- Easy to search across sessions
- Chronological by date in filename
- No need to remember subdirectory structure

```

**Find sessions by topic**:
```bash
ls /home/dave/skippy/conversations/*wordpress*session*.md
ls /home/dave/skippy/conversations/*mobile*session*.md
ls /home/dave/skippy/conversations/*deployment*session*.md
```
