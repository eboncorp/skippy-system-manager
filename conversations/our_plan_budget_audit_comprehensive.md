# COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET AUDIT REPORT
## "Our Plan for Louisville" WordPress Post 249 vs Authoritative Budget Documents

**Audit Date:** November 2, 2025
**Auditor:** Dave Biggers Campaign Budget Audit
**Scope:** Complete line-by-line comparison of WordPress post 249 against authoritative budget sources

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### CRITICAL FINDING: MAJOR BUDGET TOTAL DISCREPANCY

**WordPress Post 249 states:** $1.2 billion
**Authoritative campaign documents state:** $898.8 million
**Discrepancy:** $301.2 million (25% difference)

### AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE DETERMINATION

Based on analysis of all campaign budget documentation:

1. **BUDGET_CORRECTION_SUMMARY.md** (October 31, 2025) - Documents a correction FROM $1.025B TO $1.2B
2. **BUDGET_VERIFICATION.md** - Analyzes official Louisville Metro budget, confirms $1.2B is the rounded public figure
3. **detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md** - Uses $898.8M as the budget total

**Official Louisville Metro FY 2025-2026 Budget Components:**
- General Fund: $876.5M ($877M rounded)
- Total Available Funds: $957M (includes grants, aid, non-recurring)
- Total Appropriations: $1.14B (all funds)
- Public-facing rounded total: **$1.2B**

### KEY FINDINGS

**✅ CORRECT:** The WordPress post using **$1.2 billion** matches the current administration's public messaging
**❌ INCORRECT:** The campaign's detailed budget documents use **$898.8 million**, which doesn't match any official figure
**⚠️ INCONSISTENCY:** Internal campaign documents show confusion between $898.8M, $957M, $1.025B, and $1.2B

### RECOMMENDATION

**The WordPress post ($1.2B) is CORRECT for public-facing communications.**

The authoritative $898.8M figure in detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md appears to be **incorrect** and should be updated to match one of the official figures:
- **$1.2B** (recommended - matches current administration messaging)
- **$877M** (General Fund only - most precise)
- **$957M** (total available funds)

- Not included in the $898.8M breakdown

**FINDING:** The WordPress post includes a $27.4M Year 1 employee compensation increase that **does not appear anywhere** in the detailed budget documents. This is either:
1. An unfunded promise, OR
2. Should be embedded in departmental budgets (but isn't shown)

**STATUS:** ❌ MAJOR INCONSISTENCY - $27.4M unaccounted for

---

### 5. PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING

#### WordPress Post 249:
- **Total: $15M**
- "$577K per Metro Council district" (26 districts)
- 26 × $577K = $15,002,000 ✅ Math checks

#### detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md:
- **Total: $9M**
- "$1M per district" (6 districts)
- 6 × $1M = $6M direct spending

**DISCREPANCY:**
- WordPress: $15M across 26 Metro Council districts
- Detailed: $9M across 6 neighborhood districts

---

### 7. GENERAL GOVERNMENT

#### WordPress Post 249:
- **Total: $95M** (7.5% of $1.2B)

- Metro Council: $6M
- Law Department: $15M
- Finance: $25M
- HR: $12M
- IT: $20M
- Digital Democracy: $5M

## IDENTIFICATION OF CORRECT NUMBERS

### AUTHORITATIVE BUDGET FRAMEWORK (based on BUDGET_VERIFICATION.md):

**Option 1: Use $1.2 Billion (RECOMMENDED)**
- Matches current administration messaging
- Matches public understanding
- Simplest for voters
- Rounds from $1.14B total appropriations

**Option 2: Use $877 Million (MOST PRECISE)**
- Actual General Fund operating budget
- Where most policies would be funded
- More accurate but may confuse voters

**Option 3: Use $957 Million**
- Total available funds (GF + grants + aid)
- Includes non-recurring sources
- Middle ground

### RECOMMENDED: **$1.2 Billion** with explanation:
- "$1.2 billion total budget"
- "($877 million General Fund operating budget)"

---

## RECOMMENDED CORRECTIONS FOR WORDPRESS POST

### PRIORITY 1: FIX DEPARTMENT TOTAL MATH (CRITICAL)

The department budgets must add up to $1.2B. Current sum is $1.318B.

**Required adjustments to balance at $1.2B:**

Option A: Reduce Support Services from $315M to $196.6M
Option B: Remove employee raises from separate line (embed in departments)
Option C: Reduce all departments proportionally by 9.9%

**Recommendation:** Option B - Remove the $27.4M employee compensation line item and note that raises are embedded within each department's budget. This brings total to $1.291B, still $91M over. Then adjust Support Services down to $224M (from $315M) to balance.

### PRIORITY 2: RECONCILE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGETS

Choose one framework:

**Framework A (WordPress):**
- Police: $245.9M
- Fire: $80M
- EMS: $52M
- Other: $17.3M
- Total: $395.2M

**Framework B (Detailed - RECOMMENDED):**
- Police: $200M (detailed breakdown available)
- Fire: $144.5M (includes $18M prevention)
- EMS: $25.2M (includes crisis response)
- Codes: $10M
- Total: $379.7M

**Recommendation:** Use Framework B (detailed budget) as it has full line-item justification and internally consistent math.

**Required changes to WordPress:**
- Police: $245.9M → $200M
- Fire: $80M → $144.5M
- EMS: $52M → $25.2M
- Other: $17.3M → $10M

### PRIORITY 3: RECONCILE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS

**Current WordPress:**
- Youth: $55M
- Wellness: $45M
- Parks: $70M
- Library: $42M
- Violence Prevention: included in Youth
- Total: ~$212M (not $185M stated)

**Detailed Budget (RECOMMENDED):**
- Youth: $35M
- Wellness: $27M
- Parks: $45M
- Library: $28M
- Community Development: $40M
- Total: $175M

**Required changes to WordPress:**
- Youth: $55M → $35M (adjust program breakdown)
- Wellness: $45M → $27M ($1.5M per center, not $2.5M)
- Parks: $70M → $45M
- Library: $42M → $28M

### PRIORITY 4: RECONCILE PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING

**Current WordPress:** $15M across 26 Metro Council districts
**Detailed Budget:** $9M across 6 neighborhood districts

**Decision required:** Which program design?
- 26 existing districts (simpler) = $15M
- 6 new districts (detailed plan) = $9M

**Recommendation:** Use 6-district model ($9M) as it has detailed implementation plan in authoritative documents.

### PRIORITY 5: FIX EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

**Current WordPress:** $27.4M Year 1 as separate line item
**Detailed Budget:** No separate line item

**Options:**
A. Remove from WordPress (embed in department budgets)
B. Add to detailed budget as cross-cutting line item

**Recommendation:** Option A - Note that "24% compounded raises are embedded within each department's budget" rather than showing as separate $27.4M line.

### PRIORITY 6: RECONCILE INFRASTRUCTURE

**Current WordPress:** $241M (Public Works $115M + Capital $85M + Debt $41M)
**Detailed Budget:** $180M (different breakdown)

**Recommendation:** Use detailed budget structure ($180M) and move Debt Service to Support Services category.

### PRIORITY 7: RECONCILE SUPPORT SERVICES

**Current WordPress:** $315M
**Detailed Budget:** $64.1M

**Analysis:** These are completely different categories. WordPress appears to include things the detailed budget categorizes elsewhere.

**Recommendation:** Use detailed budget framework ($64.1M for core support) and recategorize the rest.

## WHICH DOCUMENT IS AUTHORITATIVE?

### Based on:
1. **Timestamps:** BUDGET_CORRECTION_SUMMARY.md (Oct 31, 2025) is most recent
2. **Official source analysis:** BUDGET_VERIFICATION.md analyzed official docs
3. **Internal consistency:** detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md has working math
4. **Public alignment:** WordPress matches official $1.2B figure

### DETERMINATION:

**For Budget Total:**
✅ **$1.2 Billion** - Use WordPress figure (matches official Louisville Metro)
❌ **$898.8 Million** - Discard detailed budget figure (no official basis)

**For Department Details:**
✅ **Use detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md** - Has complete line-item justification
❌ **Discard WordPress details** - Numbers don't add up and conflict with detailed

**For Program Structures:**
✅ **Use detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md** - Has implementation plans
⚠️ **WordPress has conceptual errors** - Needs to be rebuilt from detailed budget

### RECOMMENDED ACTION:

**Rebuild WordPress post using:**
1. Budget total: $1.2B (keep from WordPress)
2. All department details: From detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md
3. Scale up proportionally: Multiply all detailed budget numbers by 1.335 (1.2B / 898.8M)
4. Verify totals add up
5. Maintain program descriptions from WordPress (they're good)
6. Fix all numbers

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. **Take down WordPress post 249** - It contains too many mathematical errors to be credible if challenged

2. **Rebuild budget using authoritative framework:**
   - Total: $1.2B
   - Structure from detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md
   - Scale all numbers by 1.335×
   - Verify math

3. **Reconcile the three-way conflict:**
   - WordPress: $1.2B (right total, wrong details)
   - Detailed: $898.8M (wrong total, right structure)
   - Official: $1.2B (right total, different structure)

4. **Create single authoritative budget:**
   - One source document
   - All other docs derived from it
   - Version control
   - Change log

5. **Fix employee compensation accounting:**
   - Either: Separate $27.4M line item (add to detailed budget)
   - Or: Embedded in departments (remove from WordPress)
   - Not both and not neither

6. **Standardize participatory budgeting:**
   - Choose: 26 districts ($15M) or 6 districts ($9M)
   - Update all references
   - Ensure implementation plan matches

### LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **Establish budget version control:**
   - Single authoritative source
   - Clear version dates
   - Change log maintained
   - All public docs derived from source

2. **Create budget audit process:**
   - All numbers must trace to authoritative source
   - No conflicting figures in different documents
   - Regular reconciliation
   - Math verification before publication

3. **Simplify public communications:**
   - High-level summary (WordPress)
   - Detailed breakdown (campaign docs)
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Consistent terminology

4. **Reconcile with official Louisville budget:**
   - Use same categories where possible
   - Clear mapping where different
   - Explain variances
   - Match official total

## CONCLUSION

The WordPress "Our Plan for Louisville" post (Post 249) contains **systematic mathematical errors totaling hundreds of millions of dollars**. While it uses the correct $1.2B total budget figure (matching official Louisville Metro communications), the department-level details:

1. **Don't add up to the stated total** (sum to $1,318.4M instead of $1,200M)
2. **Contradict the authoritative detailed budget** in nearly every line item
3. **Cannot be reconciled** with the campaign's own detailed budget documents
4. **Would not withstand scrutiny** from opponents or media fact-checkers

### CRITICAL FINDING:

**None of the campaign's budget documents are fully authoritative.** There is a three-way conflict:
- WordPress uses $1.2B ✅ but has wrong details ❌
- Detailed budget uses $898.8M ❌ but has working math ✅
- Official Louisville is $1.2B ✅ but structured differently ⚠️

### RECOMMENDED AUTHORITATIVE NUMBERS:

**Use $1.2 Billion as total** with structure from detailed_budget_RESTRUCTURED.md, scaled proportionally:

| Category | Detailed ($898.8M) | Scaled ($1.2B) | WordPress | Status |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| Public Safety | $379.7M | $506.9M | $395.2M | ❌ All different |
| Community Programs | $175M | $233.6M | $185M | ❌ All different |
| Infrastructure | $180M | $240.3M | $241M | ✅ WordPress close |
| Democratic Gov | $100M | $133.5M | $95M | ⚠️ Different |
| Support Services | $64.1M | $85.6M | $315M | ❌ Major error |
| **TOTAL** | **$898.8M** | **$1,200M** | **$1,319M** | ❌ WP overbudget |

### FINAL VERDICT:

**The WordPress post is NOT SAFE to use in current form.** It requires a complete rebuild using corrected numbers from an authoritative source that reconciles:
- The correct $1.2B total (from official sources)
- The detailed program structure (from campaign detailed budget)
- Mathematical consistency (currently absent)
- Political defensibility (currently lacking)

**Estimated time to fix:** 40-60 hours of detailed budget reconciliation work.

**Risk if not fixed:** Campaign credibility destruction if media or opponents fact-check the numbers.
