## COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID

### Apostrophe Errors
- ❌ WRONG: Dave'''s (triple apostrophes)
- ✅ CORRECT: Dave's (single apostrophe)

### Family References
- ❌ WRONG: "raising a family," "his family," "wife," "children," "kids" (when referring to Dave personally)
- ✅ CORRECT: "Family oriented" (values), "Louisville families" (constituents)

### Number Inconsistencies
- ❌ WRONG: "34 policy documents"
- ✅ CORRECT: "42 policy documents" or "34 policy documents (including 16 comprehensive platform policies)"

- ❌ WRONG: "499 terms" in glossary
- ✅ CORRECT: "351 terms" in glossary

### ROI on Wellness Centers
- ⚠️ VERIFY: Some docs say "$1.80 saved per $1 spent," others say "$3 saved per $1 spent"
- **TODO:** Confirm correct figure

---

## NOTES TO VERIFY

### Unclear/Inconsistent Information
1. **Districts:** How many districts does Louisville have? (Need consistent number for "2 detectives per district")
2. **Wellness Center ROI:** $1.80 or $3.00 saved per dollar spent?
3. **Policy Document Count:** 34 vs 42 - need to clarify what we're counting
4. **Years of Experience:** Homepage says "years of experience serving our community" but doesn't specify how many - is this intentional?
