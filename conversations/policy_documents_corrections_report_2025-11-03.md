## Fix #1: Mini Substations Count (73 → 63)

### Investigation Results:
**NO CHANGES REQUIRED**

After comprehensive search of all 44 files:
- **NO instances found** of "73 mini substations" or "73 locations"
- All documents consistently reference **46 mini substations** (phased deployment over 4 years)
- Found one reference in policy_940.html stating "63 Potential Mini Police Substation Locations" which correctly matches Jefferson County's 63 ZIP codes
- The user's instruction mentioned changing "73" to "63" but no instances of "73" related to mini substations were found in any files

**Conclusion:** Either the issue was already corrected in a previous export, or the user's reference to "73" was mistaken. The current documents correctly state 46 substations with deployment aligned to ZIP code coverage.

**Files Examined:** All 44 HTML files
**Search Patterns:** "73", "73 mini", "73 locations", "73.*ZIP", "ZIP.*73"
**Result:** No corrections needed

## Files NOT Modified (But Examined)

The following files were examined but did not require changes:

### Files with "$6M" but NOT about Participatory Budgeting:
- **policy_139.html** - Contains "$6M" referring to "Mini substation construction: $6M" (infrastructure budget line item, not PB)
- **policy_146.html, policy_147.html, policy_243.html** - Contains "$6M" in other contexts (construction, operations)
- **policy_702.html through policy_712.html** - Various policy documents with $6M in unrelated contexts

These references are **CORRECT** as they refer to construction costs, operational budgets, or other line items - NOT participatory budgeting.

### Files Examined for "73" References:
All 44 files were searched for "73" - results showed references to:
- 73% statistics (food access, demographic data, startup failure rates)
- Year 1973 (historical references)
- Employer contribution rates (35.73%)
- **NONE** related to mini substations count

## Verification Procedures

### Methods Used:
1. **Pattern Search:** Used `grep` with multiple patterns to identify all instances
2. **Context Verification:** Read surrounding text to confirm changes were appropriate
3. **Precision Editing:** Used Edit tool with exact string matching to preserve HTML formatting
4. **Post-Edit Verification:** Re-searched all files to confirm old values removed and new values present
5. **Cross-Reference Check:** Verified consistency across related documents

### Quality Assurance:
✅ **No HTML formatting broken** - All tags, attributes, and structure preserved
✅ **No unintended changes** - Only target strings modified
✅ **Complete coverage** - All instances of target values updated
✅ **Consistent values** - Same corrections applied uniformly across all files
✅ **Source accuracy** - New values verified against authoritative sources (Trust for America's Health 2008, Louisville Metro Council structure)

## Issues and Resolutions

### Issue #1: Fix #1 Instructions vs. Reality
**Issue:** User requested changing "73 mini substations" to "63 mini substations" but no instances of "73" related to substations found.

**Investigation:**
- Searched all 44 files for "73" in any context
- Found policy_940.html correctly states "63 Potential Mini Police Substation Locations"
- All other documents consistently reference "46 mini substations"
- No discrepancies found

**Resolution:** Documented findings; no changes needed. Likely either:
  - Issue was already corrected in previous export
  - User's instructions referred to a different document set
  - Original error report was mistaken

### Issue #2: District Structure in policy_148.html
**Issue:** Document originally organized PB into "6 geographic districts" (clusters of Metro Council districts) rather than 26 individual districts.

**Resolution:**
- Updated all monetary values to reflect 26 districts
- Added clarification note: "Louisville has 26 individual Metro Council districts. Each receives $577,000 annually. The groupings above show geographic clusters for planning purposes."
- This preserves the organizational structure while clarifying the actual implementation (26 districts)

### Issue #3: Multiple ROI Value Formats
**Issue:** Wellness ROI appeared in different formats: "$1.80 saved per $1 spent", "$1.80 ROI per dollar spent", "$1.80 per $1", etc.

**Resolution:** Updated all formats to "$5.60" while preserving the original phrasing style for each context.

## Recommendations

### For Future Updates:
1. **Centralize Key Statistics:** Consider creating a single "Statistics Reference" document that all policy documents pull from to prevent inconsistencies
2. **Automated Validation:** Implement a pre-export check script that validates key numbers (PB budget, wellness ROI, district counts) across all documents
3. **Version Control:** Consider using variable substitution (like {{PB_BUDGET}}) in source documents before export to HTML
4. **Cross-Reference Table:** Maintain a table of "critical numbers" that must be consistent across documents

### Numbers to Monitor:
- Participatory Budgeting: $15M total, $577K per district, 26 Metro Council districts
- Wellness ROI: $5.60 saved per $1 spent (Trust for America's Health, 2008)
- Mini Substations: 46 total (phased deployment)
- ZIP Codes: 63 in Jefferson County, KY

## Technical Notes

### Tools Used:
- **Read Tool:** For examining file contents
- **Edit Tool:** For precise string replacement with HTML preservation
- **Grep Tool:** For pattern searching across multiple files
- **Bash Commands:** For verification and batch checking

### Approach:
- Used `replace_all: true` parameter when same change needed multiple times in single file
- Used exact string matching to avoid unintended modifications
- Verified each change by re-reading modified sections
- Created comprehensive search patterns to catch all variations

### File Format:
- All files are HTML (*.html)
- Preservation of HTML tags, attributes, and structure was critical
- Line numbers referenced are from cat -n format (starting at 1)
