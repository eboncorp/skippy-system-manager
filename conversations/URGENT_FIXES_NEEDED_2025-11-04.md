# URGENT: Fixes Needed for Dave Biggers Campaign Site

**Date:** November 4, 2025
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Action Required Immediately

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. VOLUNTEER SCRIPTS CONTAIN FALSE INFORMATION ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**Posts 941 & 942** (Phone Banking Script and Canvassing Talking Points)

**ERROR:** Both scripts claim Dave is a "former firefighter"
- This is FALSE - Dave was never a firefighter
- Volunteers are being given incorrect biographical information
- **URGENT:** Fix before any more volunteers use these scripts

**ERROR:** Both scripts mention "fire stations in every ZIP code"
- Should be: "mini police substations in every ZIP code"
- Fire stations ≠ police substations (completely different)
- Creates voter confusion about actual policy

**Fix Required:**
- Remove all "firefighter" references
- Change "fire stations" to "mini police substations" throughout
- Add disclaimer: "Verify information with campaign before use"

### 2. NOVEMBER 3 FIXES NEVER APPLIED TO WORDPRESS

**Context:** On Nov 3, three errors were found and fixed in EXPORTED HTML files, but the fixes were never imported back into the WordPress database.

**Error A: Participatory Budgeting - Wrong Amount**
- **Posts:** 701, 709
- **Current (WRONG):** "$5 million annually"
- **Should Be:** "$15 million annually"
- **Impact:** Understates community investment by $10M

**Error B: Wellness Centers ROI - Wrong Number**
- **Post:** 246
- **Current (WRONG):** "$3 saved per $1 spent"
- **Should Be:** "$1.80 saved per $1 spent"
- **Impact:** Overstates ROI by 67%

**Why This Happened:**
- Nov 3: Errors found in WordPress content
- Nov 3: Errors fixed in exported HTML files
- Nov 3: ❌ Fixes never re-imported to WordPress
- Result: WordPress still has wrong numbers

### 3. "FIRE STATIONS" LANGUAGE THROUGHOUT SITE

**6 documents incorrectly mention "fire stations":**
- Post 941 (Phone Banking Script)
- Post 942 (Canvassing Talking Points)
- Post 702 (Affordable Housing policy)
- Post 249 (Our Plan for Louisville)
- Post 244 (Detailed Line-Item Budget)
- Post 243 (Campaign One-Pager)

**Should Be:** "mini police substations" or "community policing substations"

**Why It Matters:**
- Fire stations = firefighters, fire trucks, medical emergencies
- Mini police substations = community policing, 2-4 officers, neighborhood presence
- Completely different policies and budgets
