# System Security Audit & Improvements Session
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Systems:** Ebonhawk (10.0.0.25) & Ebon Media Server (10.0.0.29)

## Session Summary
Comprehensive security audit and remediation of both systems, including agent status checks, vulnerability assessment, and implementation of security improvements.

## Initial Status Check

### Agents Status
- **Ebonhawk:** ebonhawk-maintenance.service - Active and running
- **Ebon:** ebon-maintenance.service - Active and running (21+ hours uptime)
- **Skippy:** Infrastructure workspace at `/home/dave/Skippy/` containing NexusController v2.0

### System Review Findings

#### Ebonhawk (10.0.0.25) Weaknesses
1. SSH agent authentication failures
2. Excessive sudo privileges (unlimited NOPASSWD for dave)
3. Exposed services (SMTP on port 25, SMB on 139/445)
4. Hardware/driver issues (Intel ISH firmware errors, Brother scanner udev rules)
5. rclone Google Drive sync errors

#### Ebon Media Server (10.0.0.29) Weaknesses
1. **CRITICAL:** 78% disk usage on root partition (only 21GB free)
2. Failed noip2.service with runaway processes
3. Exposed ports (80, 443, 8080) to internet without restrictions
4. Docker containers binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
5. Pending security updates

#### Network Security Issues
1. No fail2ban or rate limiting
2. Missing intrusion detection system
3. No automated key rotation for WireGuard VPN

## Actions Taken

### 1. Disk Space Management (CRITICAL)
- **Ebon:** Removed 17GB of old music archives
  - `/home/ebon/music_archived_20250816` (17GB)
  - `/home/ebon/music_archived_20250817` (241MB)
- **Result:** Disk usage reduced from 78% to 61%
- **Expansion:** Extended root partition from 98GB to 295GB using available LVM space
- **Final Status:** 20% disk usage with 226GB available

### 2. SSH Authentication Fix
- Re-added SSH keys to agent
- Resolved authentication failures for automated tasks

### 3. Security Updates
- Applied all pending updates on both systems
- Ebonhawk: Already up to date
- Ebon: 5 packages updated including security patches

### 4. fail2ban Installation & Configuration
- Installed on both systems
- Configured SSH protection with:
  - Standard jail: 3 attempts, 2-hour ban
  - Aggressive jail: 2 attempts in 5 minutes, 24-hour ban
  - Whitelisted local networks (10.0.0.0/24, 10.9.0.0/24)

### 5. Automatic Security Updates
- Configured unattended-upgrades on both systems
- Daily security updates enabled
- Automatic removal of unused packages
- No automatic reboot (manual control retained)

### 6. Service Fixes
- **Ebon:** Disabled problematic noip2 service
- **Ebonhawk:** Fixed Brother scanner udev rules (SYSFS → ATTRS)

### 7. Storage Discovery
- Ebon has 2x 2TB NVMe SSDs
- First drive: 1.82TB with LVM (now using 300GB for root)
- Second drive: 1.8TB mounted at `/mnt/media`
- 1.52TB still available in LVM for future expansion

## Final Security Status

### Active Protections
✅ UFW firewall active on both systems  
✅ fail2ban monitoring SSH with auto-ban  
✅ Automatic security updates enabled  
✅ Maintenance agents running and monitoring  
✅ Journal log rotation configured  
✅ Disk space healthy (Ebon: 20%, Ebonhawk: 31%)  

### Completed Improvements
1. ✅ Fixed SSH agent authentication
2. ✅ Cleaned disk space and expanded partition
3. ✅ Applied all security updates
4. ✅ Installed and configured fail2ban
5. ✅ Fixed noip2 service issue
6. ✅ Configured automatic updates
7. ✅ Fixed Brother scanner rules
8. ✅ Expanded root partition to 295GB

### Remaining Recommendations
1. **High Priority:**
   - Implement nginx/Caddy reverse proxy for Docker containers
   - Restrict sudo permissions to specific commands
   - Configure Docker containers to bind to localhost only

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Set up automated backups to second NVMe drive
   - Implement SSH key rotation schedule
   - Install IDS/IPS (Suricata or Snort)

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Configure SMTP to bind to localhost only
   - Restrict SMB to local network only
   - Address Intel ISH firmware issues
