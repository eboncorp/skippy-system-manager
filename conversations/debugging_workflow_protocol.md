# Debugging Workflow Protocol

**Date Created**: 2025-10-28
**Purpose**: Systematic debugging methodology and troubleshooting procedures
**Applies To**: All debugging tasks (WordPress, scripts, system issues)
**Priority**: HIGH (occurs 2-3 times per week)

## Overview

This protocol provides a systematic approach to debugging issues rather than trial-and-error. Following this workflow reduces debugging time and ensures problems are properly documented for future reference.

## Core Debugging Principles

### 1. Systematic Approach
✅ **DO**: Work methodically through diagnosis steps
✅ **DO**: Document each attempt and result
✅ **DO**: Test one variable at a time
❌ **DON'T**: Try random fixes hoping something works
❌ **DON'T**: Skip documentation
❌ **DON'T**: Change multiple things simultaneously

### 2. Understand Before Fixing
✅ **DO**: Identify root cause before applying fixes
✅ **DO**: Reproduce the issue consistently
✅ **DO**: Understand what changed to cause the issue
❌ **DON'T**: Apply fixes without understanding why they work
❌ **DON'T**: Implement workarounds without investigating cause

### 3. Documentation
✅ **DO**: Log all errors encountered
✅ **DO**: Document solutions that work
✅ **DO**: Update protocols with prevention measures
❌ **DON'T**: Forget to document once problem is solved

## Debugging Workflow (5-Step Process)

### Step 1: Problem Identification

#### Gather Information
```bash
# Ask these questions:
1. What is the expected behavior?
2. What is the actual behavior?
3. When did it start failing?
4. What changed recently?
5. Can you reproduce it consistently?
6. Does it fail for everyone or specific users/conditions?
```

#### Document Initial State
- [ ] Error message captured (exact text)
- [ ] Screenshots taken (if UI issue)
- [ ] Reproduction steps documented
- [ ] Environment details noted (local/production, OS, browser, etc.)
- [ ] Recent changes identified

#### Create Error Log
Reference: `/home/dave/skippy/conversations/error_logging_protocol.md`

```bash
# Create error log immediately
ERROR_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H%M)
ERROR_FILE="/home/dave/skippy/conversations/error_logs/2025-10/error_${ERROR_DATE}_[brief_description].md"

# Document:
# - What you were trying to do
# - What went wrong
# - Error messages
# - Environment details
```

---

### Step 2: Information Gathering

#### Check Logs
```bash
# WordPress error logs
tail -100 /home/dave/Local\ Sites/rundaverun-local/app/public/wp-content/debug.log

# System logs
journalctl -xe --since "10 minutes ago"

# Apache/nginx logs (if applicable)
tail -100 /var/log/apache2/error.log

# Application logs (if applicable)
tail -100 /path/to/app/logs/error.log
```

#### Check System State
```bash
# Disk space
df -h

# Memory usage
free -h

# Process status
ps aux | grep [relevant_process]

# Service status
systemctl status [service_name]
```

#### Browser DevTools (For Web Issues)
- [ ] Console errors checked (F12 → Console)
- [ ] Network tab checked (failed requests, 404s, 500s)
- [ ] Response codes noted
- [ ] Request/response headers examined
- [ ] JavaScript errors identified

#### WordPress-Specific Checks
```bash
cd "/home/dave/Local Sites/rundaverun-local/app/public"

# Check WordPress status
wp core verify-checksums --allow-root
wp plugin list --allow-root
wp theme list --allow-root

# Check database connection
wp db check --allow-root

# Check for errors in database
wp db query "SELECT * FROM wp_7e1ce15f22_options WHERE option_name = 'siteurl'" --allow-root
```

---

### Step 3: Hypothesis Formation

#### Identify Possible Causes
Based on information gathered, list potential causes in priority order:

**1. Most Likely Cause**: [Based on error message and recent changes]
**2. Second Most Likely**: [Based on similar past issues]
**3. Third Most Likely**: [Based on environmental factors]

#### Create Test Plan
For each hypothesis, define:
- What to test
- How to test it
- Expected result if hypothesis is correct
- How to verify fix worked

**Example**:
```markdown
**Hypothesis 1**: File permissions preventing WordPress from writing
**Test**: Check permissions on wp-content/uploads/
**Expected**: Directory should be 755, files should be 644
**Verification**: Upload test image through WordPress admin
```

---

### Step 4: Testing & Validation

#### Test One Variable at a Time

**❌ WRONG APPROACH**:
```bash
# Changing multiple things at once
chmod -R 777 wp-content/
wp cache flush --allow-root
wp plugin deactivate --all --allow-root
# Now you don't know what fixed it!
```

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH**:
```bash
# Test 1: Check current permissions
ls -la wp-content/uploads/

# Test 2: Fix permissions if needed
chmod 755 wp-content/uploads/

# Test 3: Verify fix
# Try upload again

# If still failing, move to next hypothesis
```

#### Document Each Attempt
```markdown
**Attempt 1**: Changed wp-content/uploads/ permissions to 755
**Result**: Still failing
**Error**: Same error message
**Next Step**: Check if uploads directory exists
```

#### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Issue is resolved
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Solution works consistently (test 3+ times)
- [ ] Solution works in all affected environments
- [ ] Root cause identified and understood

---

### Step 5: Documentation & Prevention

#### Update Error Log
```markdown
## Solution
Changed file permissions on wp-content/uploads/ from 600 to 755.

## Root Cause
GoDaddy file upload through cPanel set incorrect permissions (600 instead of 644).

## Prevention
- Always check permissions after cPanel file uploads
- Use deployment script that sets correct permissions
- Add permission check to deployment checklist
```

#### Update Relevant Protocols
If this issue reveals a gap in existing protocols:
- Update deployment checklist
- Add to common errors guide
- Create prevention measure
- Update quick reference docs

#### Create Prevention Measures
```bash
# Example: Add permission check to deployment script
echo "Checking file permissions..."
find wp-content -type f -not -perm 644 -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find wp-content -type d -not -perm 755 -exec chmod 755 {} \;
echo "✅ Permissions fixed"
```

## Common Problem Patterns

### Pattern 1: "It worked locally but not in production"

**Likely Causes**:
1. Database URLs not updated (local URLs in production)
2. File permissions different (600 in production vs 644 local)
3. Plugin/theme files not uploaded
4. Cache showing old version
5. PHP version differences

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check URLs in database
wp db query "SELECT option_value FROM wp_7e1ce15f22_options WHERE option_name IN ('siteurl', 'home')" --allow-root

# 2. Check file permissions
ls -la wp-content/themes/[theme-name]/

# 3. Verify files exist
ls -la wp-content/uploads/[new-files]

# 4. Clear all caches
wp cache flush --allow-root

# 5. Check PHP version
php -v
```

### Pattern 2: "It worked yesterday but broke today"

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. What changed? Check git
git log --since="yesterday" --oneline

# 2. Were plugins/themes updated?
wp plugin list --allow-root
# Check for recent update timestamps

# 3. Check error logs for new errors
tail -50 wp-content/debug.log

# 4. Check if hosting made changes
# Review GoDaddy notifications/emails

# 5. Check if SSL certificate expired
curl -I https://rundaverun.org
```

### Pattern 3: "Works in Chrome but not Firefox/Safari"

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Open DevTools in failing browser (F12)
2. Check Console for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Check CSS compatibility (prefixes, newer features)
5. Test in private/incognito mode (cache issue?)

**Common Causes**:
- Browser-specific CSS issues
- JavaScript features not supported
- Cookie/localStorage differences
- Cache showing old version

### Pattern 4: "Mobile menu not working"

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check if injector file exists
ls -la wp-content/mu-plugins/mobile-menu-injector.php

# 2. Check file permissions
ls -la wp-content/mu-plugins/mobile-menu-injector.php
# Should be 644

# 3. Test JavaScript
# Open mobile DevTools (F12 → Toggle device toolbar)
# Check Console for errors

# 4. Check z-index conflicts
# Inspect menu element
# Verify z-index is high enough (e.g., 9999)

# 5. Test on actual mobile device
# Not just DevTools simulation
```

### Pattern 5: "Database import failed"

**Investigation Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Check database file exists and is not empty
ls -lh backup.sql

# 2. Check for SQL syntax errors
head -20 backup.sql
# Look for proper SQL syntax

# 3. Try importing with error output
wp db import backup.sql --allow-root 2>&1 | tee import_errors.log

# 4. Check database connection
wp db check --allow-root

# 5. Verify table prefix matches
# In backup.sql, tables should start with: wp_7e1ce15f22_
# Check wp-config.php: $table_prefix = 'wp_7e1ce15f22_';
```

## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Binary Search Debugging

When you have many potential causes, use binary search to narrow down:

```bash
# Example: Which plugin is causing the issue?
# Instead of testing plugins one by one (linear search),
# divide and conquer:

# 1. Deactivate all plugins
wp plugin deactivate --all --allow-root

# 2. Activate half of them
wp plugin activate plugin1 plugin2 plugin3 --allow-root

# 3. Test - does issue occur?
#    - YES: Issue is in first half, deactivate all, test other half
#    - NO: Issue is in second half, activate second half

# 4. Repeat until you find the problematic plugin
```

### Diff Debugging

Compare working vs broken:

```bash
# Compare local (working) vs production (broken)
# Export both databases
wp db export local_working.sql --allow-root
# Download production database

# Compare specific tables
diff <(grep "option_name" local_working.sql) \
     <(grep "option_name" production_broken.sql)

# Compare file contents
diff -r /local/wp-content/themes/campaign/ \
        /production/wp-content/themes/campaign/
```

### Logging Debugging

Add temporary logging to narrow down issue:

```php
// In WordPress theme/plugin file
error_log("DEBUG: Reached line 123");
error_log("DEBUG: Variable value: " . print_r($variable, true));

// Then check debug.log
// tail -f wp-content/debug.log
```

### Network Debugging

Use browser DevTools Network tab:

```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reproduce issue
4. Look for:
   - Failed requests (red)
   - 404 errors (missing files)
   - 500 errors (server errors)
   - Slow requests (performance issues)
5. Click on failed request to see details:
   - Request headers
   - Response headers
   - Response body (error message)
```

---

## Debugging Mindset

### Stay Calm and Methodical
- Debugging is problem-solving, not guesswork
- Follow the process even when frustrated
- Take breaks if stuck for 30+ minutes
- Ask for help after exhausting systematic approaches

### Document Everything
- Future you will thank present you
- Others can learn from your investigation
- Patterns become visible over time
- Prevention measures come from good documentation

### Learn from Every Issue
- Every bug teaches something
- Update protocols after solving issues
- Share solutions with team/community
- Build your mental model of the system

### When to Ask for Help
- After exhausting systematic debugging steps
- When issue is outside your expertise
- When time-critical and stuck
- When you need fresh perspective

**Before asking for help, document**:
- What you've tried
- What you've ruled out
- Current hypothesis
- Relevant error messages/logs

---

## Quick Reference

### Debugging Process (Summary)
1. **Identify**: Gather info, document error, create error log
2. **Investigate**: Check logs, system state, browser DevTools
3. **Hypothesize**: List possible causes, create test plan
4. **Test**: Test one variable at a time, document attempts
5. **Document**: Update error log, update protocols, create prevention

### Most Common Issues (Top 10)
1. File permissions (600 vs 644)
2. Database URLs (local vs production)
3. Cache not cleared
4. Files not uploaded during deployment
5. GoDaddy custom table prefix
6. Mobile menu z-index conflicts
7. Plugin conflicts
