## Summary
Completed comprehensive security audit and configured Google Drive backup automation for the ebon server.

## Key Activities

### 1. Security Audit Completion ✅
**Final Task: Docker Security Review**
- ✅ Verified all containers run non-privileged (Privileged=false)
- ✅ Confirmed proper restart policies (unless-stopped)
- ✅ Checked user configurations (nexus, node-red users properly set)
- ✅ Validated no excessive capabilities granted
- ✅ All containers healthy and properly secured

**System Hardening Check**
- ✅ Kernel protection settings verified (kptr_restrict=1, ptrace_scope=1)
- ✅ Password policies configured (yescrypt hashing, login retries)
- ✅ Crash dumps present but contained (old nodejs/scanimage crashes)
- ✅ Filesystem protections active

### 2. Security Audit Results 🔒
**FINAL STATUS: SYSTEM SECURE**

**Firewall:** ✅ UFW active with restrictive policies
**SSH:** ✅ Key-based auth, root disabled, rate limited
**Docker:** ✅ Non-privileged containers, proper policies
**Users:** ✅ Minimal accounts, appropriate sudo access
**Updates:** ✅ Current with auto-updates enabled
**Hardening:** ✅ Kernel protections, modern crypto
**Monitoring:** ✅ Comprehensive real-time alerts

**Minor Recommendations:**
- Reboot for kernel update (5.15.0-151 → 5.15.0-156)
- Clear old crash dumps when convenient

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ Created backup directory: `googledrive:Backups/ebon/`
- ✅ Added cron job: `35 2 * * * /home/ebon/gdrive_backup.sh`
- ✅ Verified crontab configuration

**Final Backup Schedule:**
- **2:30 AM:** Local backup (`simple_backup.sh`)
- **2:35 AM:** Google Drive backup (`gdrive_backup.sh`)
