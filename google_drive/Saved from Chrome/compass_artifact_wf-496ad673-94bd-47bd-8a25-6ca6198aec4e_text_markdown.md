# Comprehensive Supermicro Infrastructure Hardware Recommendation Report

## Infrastructure overview and optimal configuration

This report provides detailed hardware recommendations for building a professional-grade multi-server Supermicro infrastructure optimized for Ethereum nodes, Chainlink operations, massive media storage, and network services. Based on extensive research of current market conditions and technical requirements, I've developed a tiered approach that maximizes performance while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

The recommended infrastructure centers around two complementary Supermicro server models: the SSG-6028R-E1CR24N for storage-intensive applications and the SYS-6018U-TR4T+ for compute-focused workloads. This combination provides exceptional flexibility for diverse workloads while maintaining enterprise reliability.

## Supermicro server recommendations by service type

### Primary Storage Server: SSG-6028R-E1CR24N
The 24-bay SuperStorage server emerges as the optimal choice for both Ethereum archival node operations and massive media storage. With support for dual Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3/v4 processors and up to 3TB of DDR4 ECC memory, this 2U server provides unmatched storage density.

**Ethereum Archival Node Configuration:**
- CPU: Dual E5-2680v3 (12-core, 2.5GHz) - $400 refurbished pair
- RAM: 256GB DDR4-2400 ECC (8x32GB) - $600 refurbished
- Storage: 4x 2TB NVMe for active blockchain + 8x 18TB SATA for archives
- Cost: ~$5,500 configured with refurbished base ($1,800) and new drives

**Media Server Configuration:**
- CPU: Dual E5-2640v3 (8-core, sufficient for storage tasks) - $200 pair
- RAM: 128GB DDR4 ECC - $350 refurbished  
- Storage: 20x 18TB drives in RAID-60 configuration (324TB usable)
- Cost: ~$7,200 with focus on maximum storage capacity

### Compute/Services Server: SYS-6018U-TR4T+
This 1U server excels for Chainlink nodes and firewall/router applications with its built-in quad 10GbE ports and efficient power consumption. The compact form factor makes it ideal for services requiring high network throughput but moderate storage.

**Chainlink Node Configuration:**
- CPU: Dual E5-2630v3 (8-core, 2.4GHz) - $150 refurbished pair
- RAM: 64GB DDR4 ECC - $200 refurbished
- Storage: 2x 1TB NVMe in RAID-1 for redundancy
- Cost: ~$1,200 fully configured

## Ethereum node infrastructure analysis

Current Ethereum full nodes require approximately 1.1TB of storage with a growth rate of 14GB weekly. For future-proofing, I recommend starting with 2TB NVMe storage which provides runway until late 2026. The upcoming EIP-4444 implementation will cap storage requirements at approximately 700GB, making full node operation significantly more accessible.

**Full Node vs Archival Node Decision Matrix:**
- **Choose Full Node if:** Running personal validators, deploying smart contracts, or supporting general DeFi operations
- **Choose Archival Node if:** Operating block explorers, conducting historical analysis, or providing infrastructure services

For archival nodes, Erigon client offers the most efficient storage utilization at 2-3TB compared to Geth's 15TB+ requirement. The 6028R-E1CR24N server can easily accommodate either configuration with room for growth.

**Recommended Hardware Specifications:**
- NVMe SSD: Samsung 990 Pro or SK Hynix P41 (minimum 10,000 read IOPS)
- Network: Stable 25Mbps+ connection without data caps
- Power: Uninterruptible power supply essential for data integrity

## Storage architecture for massive media collections

Based on current market analysis, 18TB drives offer the optimal price point at $14.17/TB. For a large CD collection digitization project, I recommend the following tiered storage approach:

**Primary Storage Array:**
- Configuration: RAID-60 across 20x 18TB drives
- Usable Capacity: 288TB (accounting for dual parity)
- Performance: Excellent streaming capability with fault tolerance
- Cost: $5,100 for drives alone

**Backup Strategy Implementation:**
- Primary: ZFS snapshots with incremental replication to secondary array
- Secondary: LTO-8 tape backup for cold storage ($61 per 12TB tape)
- Tertiary: Selective cloud backup for irreplaceable content

ZFS provides superior data integrity through checksumming and self-healing capabilities. The built-in compression can reduce storage requirements by 20-40% for typical media files. Hardware RAID remains viable but lacks ZFS's advanced features.

## 10 Gigabit Ethernet infrastructure design

The MikroTik CRS309-1G-8S+IN emerges as the optimal switch choice, offering 8x SFP+ ports for $229 ($29/port). This fanless switch consumes only 7-9W while providing enterprise L2/L3 features.

**Network Architecture:**
- Core Switch: MikroTik CRS309-1G-8S+IN
- Server Connections: SFP+ DAC cables (lowest latency, $15-30 each)
- Uplinks: 10GbE to 1GbE switches for client access
- Management: Separate VLAN for IPMI/out-of-band access

**VLAN Segmentation Plan:**
1. Management (VLAN 10): IPMI and infrastructure
2. Production (VLAN 20): Primary services
3. Storage (VLAN 40): Dedicated SAN/NAS traffic
4. DMZ (VLAN 30): Internet-facing services

Alternative premium option: Ubiquiti Switch Aggregation at $279 provides similar capabilities with integrated UniFi management.

## Power, cooling, and rack infrastructure

**Power Requirements Calculation:**
- 6028R-E1CR24N: 600-800W typical load
- SYS-6018U-TR4T+ (x2): 300W each
- Network equipment: 150W
- **Total Load:** 1,550-1,750W

**UPS Recommendations:**
- Primary: APC SMX3000RMLV2U (3kVA/2.7kW) - $1,400
- Runtime: 15-20 minutes at full load
- Features: Network management card for graceful shutdown

**Rack Specifications:**
- Size: 25U minimum, 42U recommended for expansion
- Depth: 39-42 inches for proper cable management
- Model: StarTech 25U 4-post rack - $450

**Cooling Requirements:**
- Heat Load: 5,950-5,975 BTU/hour
