SECTION I: INTRODUCTION

A. LETTER FROM THE MAYOR

To the Honorable Members of the Louisville Metro Council and Citizens of Louisville:

I present this transformative budget for Fiscal Year 2024-2025, representing a fundamental shift in how we approach public service and community well-being. This $967,842,600 budget demonstrates our commitment to both fiscal responsibility and progressive governance while revolutionizing our approach to public safety, employee welfare, and community services.

Through strategic consolidation and modernization, we have created capacity for historic investments in prevention, community wellness, and employee benefits - all without increasing our total budget. The reallocation of resources prioritizes addressing root causes over reactive measures, investing in our workforce, and building strong community partnerships.

Key innovations in this budget include:

1. A transformation of public safety focusing on prevention and community engagement
2. Historic enhancement of employee benefits matching industry leaders
3. Significant investment in community wellness and prevention programs
4. Administrative consolidation generating substantial efficiencies
5. Technology modernization improving service delivery

This budget maintains essential services while implementing forward-thinking solutions for our city's challenges. It represents careful consideration of community needs, employee welfare, and fiscal responsibility.

The pages that follow detail specific allocations, implementation timelines, and success metrics for each initiative. I look forward to working with the Council to refine and implement this vision for a safer, stronger, and healthier Louisville.

Sincerely,
[Mayor's Name]
Mayor
