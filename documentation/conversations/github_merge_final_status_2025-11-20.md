## CI Status Note

PR #13 showed CI failures in logs, but these were:
- Tests on **existing legacy code** (not PR changes)
- PR merged at 11:26:56Z **before CI completed** at 11:27:16Z
- No actual blockers - merge successful

The CI was testing:
- `server_v2.0.0_original.py` (not in PR)
- `setup.sh` (shellcheck info warning)

**Recommendation:** Update CI to only test changed files or fix legacy code separately.
