# Fix SSH Authentication Issues
echo "=== SSH Authentication Fix ==="

echo "The SSH warnings occur because your SSH keys are passphrase-protected."
echo "The music optimizer script is working fine with password authentication."
echo ""
echo "To eliminate these warnings, you have these options:"
echo ""
echo "1. TEMPORARY FIX (Current Session):"
echo "   eval \$(ssh-agent)"
echo "   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519"
echo "   # Enter your passphrase when prompted"
echo ""
echo "2. PERMANENT FIX - Create a passwordless key (less secure):"
echo "   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_nopass -N ''"
echo "   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_nopass.pub ebon@10.0.0.29"
echo "   # Then update scripts to use this key"
echo ""
echo "3. USE SSH CONFIG (Recommended):"
echo "   Add to ~/.ssh/config:"
echo "   Host ebon-server"
echo "       HostName 10.0.0.29"
echo "       User ebon"
echo "       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_nopass"
echo "       PasswordAuthentication yes"
echo "       PreferredAuthentications password,publickey"

echo "4. INSTALL SSH-ASKPASS for GUI prompts:"
echo "   sudo apt-get install ssh-askpass-gnome"
echo ""
echo "Note: The music optimizer is working correctly despite these warnings."
echo "The warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality."
