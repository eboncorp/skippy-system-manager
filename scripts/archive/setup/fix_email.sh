echo "================================"
echo ""
echo "Option 1: Use a simple SMTP relay service"
echo "- Install postfix with Gmail relay"
echo "- More reliable than ssmtp"
echo ""
echo "Option 2: Use external notification service"
echo "- Pushover, Slack, Discord webhooks"
echo "- More reliable for alerts"
echo ""
echo "Option 3: File-based alerts only"
echo "- Alerts go to /home/ebon/monitor_alerts.log"
echo "- Check manually or with log monitoring"

echo "Would you like me to:"
echo "1. Set up Postfix with Gmail relay (recommended)"
echo "2. Configure webhook notifications"
echo "3. Keep file-based alerts only"
