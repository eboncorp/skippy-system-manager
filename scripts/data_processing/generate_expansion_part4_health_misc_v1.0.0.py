        "term": "Harm Reduction",
        "definition": "A public health approach that meets people struggling with addiction where they are, providing services to reduce health risks and deaths without requiring abstinence as a precondition for help. Harm reduction includes needle exchange programs (preventing HIV/hepatitis transmission), naloxone distribution (reversing opioid overdoses), safe consumption sites, and low-barrier access to treatment. This approach prioritizes saving lives and reducing suffering over moral judgments.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville faces an ongoing opioid crisis with over 600 overdose deaths in Jefferson County in 2023—higher than homicide deaths. Current approach relies heavily on law enforcement and requires abstinence for most treatment, limiting effectiveness. Louisville has no safe consumption sites, limited needle exchange access, and insufficient low-barrier treatment. Peer cities implementing comprehensive harm reduction have reduced overdose deaths 30-50%.",
        "why_it_matters": "People are dying preventable deaths because Louisville's approach prioritizes punishment over public health. Harm reduction saves lives immediately while connecting people to long-term recovery. Opposition to harm reduction is often based on stigma and misunderstanding—research consistently shows these approaches reduce deaths, disease, and public health costs without increasing drug use.",
        "related_terms": "Substance Abuse Treatment, Opioid Crisis, Public Health, Community Wellness Center, Overdose Prevention",
        "dave_proposal": "Dave's Community Wellness Centers will offer harm reduction services: needle exchange, naloxone distribution, wound care, and pathways to treatment without abstinence requirements. He'll advocate for Kentucky to allow safe consumption sites and expand medication-assisted treatment access. All services funded within the $1.025 billion budget, prioritizing neighborhoods with highest overdose rates.",

        "term": "Needle Exchange Program",
        "definition": "Public health services that provide clean syringes to people who inject drugs in exchange for used ones, preventing transmission of HIV, hepatitis C, and other bloodborne diseases. Needle exchange programs also provide disposal of used syringes (reducing community needle litter), HIV/hepatitis testing, overdose prevention education, naloxone distribution, and connections to treatment. Research conclusively shows needle exchange reduces disease transmission without increasing drug use.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Kentucky legalized needle exchange programs in 2015, but Louisville's program has faced political opposition, funding limitations, and restrictive hours (only operating limited days/hours at single location). Jefferson County has hepatitis C infection rates significantly above national average, driven largely by injection drug use. Expanding needle exchange could prevent hundreds of infections annually and reduce healthcare costs substantially.",
        "why_it_matters": "Restricting needle exchange based on moral opposition to drug use causes preventable HIV and hepatitis infections that cost millions in treatment and cause immense suffering. Clean needles also reduce improperly disposed syringes in neighborhoods. Needle exchange is evidence-based public health that saves lives and money—opposition is based on stigma, not science.",
        "related_terms": "Harm Reduction, HIV Prevention, Hepatitis C, Public Health, Substance Abuse",

        "term": "Overdose Prevention",
        "definition": "Strategies to prevent deaths from drug overdoses, particularly opioid overdoses. Prevention includes naloxone (Narcan) distribution to reverse overdoses, education recognizing overdose signs, Good Samaritan laws protecting people who call 911 during overdoses from prosecution, safe consumption sites where medical staff can intervene, and expanded treatment access. Overdose prevention prioritizes keeping people alive until they're ready for recovery.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Jefferson County had over 600 overdose deaths in 2023—more than homicides, suicides, and traffic fatalities combined. Most deaths occur when people use alone and no one is present to call 911 or administer naloxone. Kentucky has a Good Samaritan law but many people still fear calling 911 due to criminalization. Louisville distributes naloxone through health department and some pharmacies, but access remains limited in highest-need neighborhoods.",
        "why_it_matters": "Overdose deaths are largely preventable with evidence-based interventions. Each death represents a person who could have recovered with proper support. The opioid crisis particularly affects working-class white communities that often lack access to treatment and harm reduction services. Overdose prevention requires treating addiction as a health issue, not a moral failing.",

        "dave_proposal": "Dave will make naloxone freely available at all Community Wellness Centers, libraries, Metro Parks facilities, and through community distribution. He'll ensure all LMPD officers and firefighters carry naloxone and receive training in overdose response that prioritizes health over arrest. He'll advocate for safe consumption sites in areas with highest overdose rates, funded within $1.025 billion budget.",

        "term": "Community Health Worker",
        "definition": "Trusted community members trained to provide health education, connect neighbors to services, advocate for community health needs, and bridge the gap between communities and healthcare systems. Community Health Workers (CHWs) share cultural background, language, and lived experience with the communities they serve, enabling trust that professional healthcare workers often can't achieve. CHWs improve health outcomes, reduce emergency room use, and cost far less than traditional healthcare providers.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville has limited Community Health Worker programs, primarily through a few nonprofits and health systems. West Louisville neighborhoods with worst health outcomes lack sufficient CHWs despite clear need. Medicaid reimbursement for CHW services is limited in Kentucky, making sustainable funding difficult. Peer cities with robust CHW programs have documented improved chronic disease management, better maternal health, and reduced healthcare costs.",
        "why_it_matters": "Healthcare system failures often result from distrust, cultural barriers, lack of information, and inability to navigate complex systems—problems doctors can't solve but CHWs can. West Louisville's health disparities require trusted community members helping neighbors access care, manage chronic diseases, and advocate for health needs. CHWs provide highest-return health investment for underserved communities.",

Maternal health outcomes in the US lag other developed nations, with particular disparities: Black women die from pregnancy-related causes at 3-4 times the rate of white women regardless of income or education. Major causes of maternal mortality include hemorrhage, infection, hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions—most preventable with quality prenatal and postpartum care.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville reflects national maternal health crisis: Black women in Jefferson County experience maternal mortality rates 3-4 times higher than white women. Contributing factors include lack of prenatal care (especially in West Louisville), implicit bias in healthcare, limited postpartum support, and healthcare deserts in underserved neighborhoods. Many maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period when women have lost pregnancy-related insurance coverage and lack follow-up care.",
        "why_it_matters": "Black women dying from preventable pregnancy complications at rates similar to developing nations is a moral catastrophe reflecting systemic racism in healthcare. These deaths are largely preventable through improved prenatal care access, provider bias training, postpartum home visits, and Community Health Workers supporting high-risk pregnancies. Maternal health disparities demand urgent action.",

        "term": "Food Desert",
        "definition": "Areas where residents lack access to affordable, nutritious food—typically defined as living more than 1 mile from a supermarket in urban areas (10 miles in rural areas) without reliable transportation. Food deserts force residents to rely on convenience stores and fast food, contributing to diet-related diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Food deserts disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color due to decades of disinvestment and grocery store redlining.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "West Louisville is a severe food desert: when Kroger closed its Portland and Shawnee locations in recent years, tens of thousands of residents lost walkable access to full-service groceries. Residents must travel miles via limited public transit or rely on dollar stores and gas stations selling primarily processed foods. East End has multiple supermarkets within easy reach. This geographic inequality directly contributes to West Louisville's higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.",
        "why_it_matters": "Lack of healthy food access is environmental injustice causing preventable disease and premature death. When grocery stores abandon neighborhoods, residents—especially those without cars—cannot access basic nutrition for healthy living. Food deserts perpetuate health inequities and economic disadvantage, trapping communities in cycles of poor health.",
        "related_terms": "Health Equity, Environmental Justice, Nutrition Access, Health Disparities, Economic Inequality",
        "dave_proposal": "Dave will use economic development incentives strategically to attract full-service groceries to food desert neighborhoods, prioritizing cooperative and locally-owned models over national chains. Community Wellness Centers will host weekly farmers markets accepting SNAP benefits. He'll support community gardens and urban farming initiatives. All programs funded within $1.025 billion budget.",
        "aliases": "Food Access, Grocery Access, Food Insecurity, Nutrition Access"
    },
    {
        "term": "Nutrition Access",
        "definition": "Ability to obtain healthy, affordable food necessary for proper nutrition and health. Nutrition access requires not just food availability but also affordability (food costs relative to income), acceptability (culturally appropriate foods), and accessibility (transportation, store hours, mobility accommodations). Poor nutrition access contributes to diet-related diseases including diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and certain cancers that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Beyond food deserts, Louisville faces nutrition access challenges including high poverty rates limiting food budgets, SNAP benefit inadequacy ($6-7 per person per day), limited farmers markets in low-income neighborhoods, and lack of nutrition education. West Louisville residents often pay more for food due to limited competition and lack of full-service groceries. Meanwhile, East End has abundant supermarkets, farmers markets, health food stores, and affordability.",
        "why_it_matters": "Nutrition is foundational to health, child development, academic performance, and economic productivity. When families can't afford or access healthy food, children's development suffers and chronic diseases flourish. Nutrition inequality perpetuates broader health and economic disparities across generations.",
        "related_terms": "Food Desert, SNAP Benefits, Health Equity, Community Wellness Center, Public Health",
        "dave_proposal": "Dave will expand nutrition access through Community Wellness Centers hosting cooking classes, nutrition education, weekly farmers markets accepting SNAP with matching programs (SNAP dollars go twice as far), and connections to food assistance programs. He'll advocate for Kentucky to increase SNAP benefits and work to attract full-service groceries to underserved areas, all within $1.025 billion budget.",

    {
        "term": "SNAP Benefits (Food Stamps)",
        "definition": "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides monthly benefits (loaded on EBT cards) to help low-income individuals and families purchase food. SNAP is federally funded but administered by states. Benefits average $6-7 per person per day. SNAP reduces hunger and food insecurity, improves child health and academic performance, and stimulates local economies ($1 in SNAP generates $1.50-1.80 in economic activity). Despite stigma, SNAP fraud rates are under 1%.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Approximately 110,000 Jefferson County residents (17%) receive SNAP benefits, with rates exceeding 30% in West Louisville neighborhoods. Benefits average $180-200 per person monthly—insufficient for nutritious food for the month, forcing difficult tradeoffs. Kentucky has restrictive SNAP policies including work requirements and time limits for able-bodied adults without dependents. Application process is complex and often requires multiple document submissions, creating barriers for eligible residents.",
        "why_it_matters": "SNAP keeps families fed and children healthy while supporting local groceries and farmers through food purchases. Stigmatizing SNAP or creating barriers to access harms vulnerable residents and local economy. Most SNAP recipients work but earn poverty wages insufficient for basic needs. SNAP isn't welfare—it's essential nutrition support for working families, seniors, and disabled residents.",

        "definition": "A federal nutrition program providing supplemental foods, nutrition education, and healthcare referrals to low-income pregnant women, new mothers, and children under 5 at nutritional risk. WIC provides specific food packages (infant formula, baby food, milk, eggs, cereal, fruits, vegetables) and supports breastfeeding. WIC improves birth outcomes, reduces infant mortality, and supports early childhood development. Unlike SNAP, WIC provides specific nutritious foods rather than general food purchasing power.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Approximately 18,000 Jefferson County women and children receive WIC benefits through the Louisville Metro Health Department. However, WIC enrollment captures only about 60% of eligible residents due to lack of awareness, application barriers, and stigma. WIC clinics are concentrated downtown with limited access in West Louisville neighborhoods lacking transportation. WIC vendors (stores accepting WIC) are sparse in food desert areas.",
        "why_it_matters": "Pregnancy and early childhood are critical periods where nutrition profoundly affects lifelong health and development. WIC prevents low birth weight, anemia, and poor child development while supporting maternal health. Low WIC enrollment means eligible families miss crucial nutrition support that could improve outcomes. Improving WIC access should be a public health priority.",

        "definition": "Having public or private health insurance that pays for medical care, preventing financial catastrophe from healthcare costs. The uninsured delay care, face medical bankruptcy, and die at higher rates from preventable/treatable conditions. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage through Medicaid expansion and subsidized marketplace plans, but gaps remain: people earning too much for Medicaid but too little to afford marketplace plans, and undocumented immigrants excluded from public programs.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Approximately 10-12% of Jefferson County residents (75,000-90,000 people) lack health insurance despite Kentucky's Medicaid expansion. Uninsured rates are highest in low-income neighborhoods and among Hispanic residents (many undocumented and ineligible for public programs). The uninsured rely on emergency rooms for care, driving hospital costs and uncompensated care that get passed to insured residents through higher premiums.",
        "why_it_matters": "Lack of health insurance causes preventable suffering and death. The uninsured skip medications, delay care for serious conditions, and face medical bankruptcy. Children without insurance miss preventive care and fall behind in school due to untreated health problems. Reducing uninsurance improves community health and reduces costs for everyone.",

        "definition": "Medical services priced based on patients' ability to pay, with low-income patients paying reduced fees and the very poor receiving free care. Sliding scale clinics calculate fees based on household income and size using federal poverty guidelines. This model enables access to primary care, dental care, mental health services, and medications for uninsured and underinsured residents who can't afford standard healthcare prices.",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville has several Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) offering sliding scale services: Family Health Centers, Americana Community Center, and others. However, capacity is limited and wait times for appointments can stretch weeks or months. Dental and mental health services have particularly long waits. Many uninsured Louisville residents don't know sliding scale clinics exist or how to access them.",
        "why_it_matters": "Sliding scale healthcare provides essential safety net for the uninsured and underinsured, preventing conditions from becoming emergencies and reducing reliance on expensive emergency room care. However, insufficient capacity means many who need sliding scale services can't access them in reasonable timeframes, leading to delayed care and worse outcomes.",

Dental coverage is often separate from medical insurance, and Medicaid dental benefits for adults are limited in many states. Poor dental access leads to preventable tooth loss, chronic pain, infections, difficulty eating nutritious food, barriers to employment (due to appearance), and overall health problems (oral health affects heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy outcomes).",
        "category": "Health & Social Services",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville faces severe dental access problems, particularly for low-income adults. Kentucky Medicaid covers limited adult dental services (only extractions and emergency care, no preventive care or restorations). Few dentists accept Medicaid due to low reimbursement. Sliding scale dental clinics have months-long wait lists. Emergency rooms see thousands of dental-related visits annually—expensive, inappropriate care that doesn't address underlying problems.",
        "why_it_matters": "Dental problems cause immense suffering while creating barriers to employment and perpetuating poverty. Tooth pain makes eating, sleeping, working, and parenting difficult. Visible tooth loss creates stigma and employment discrimination. Lack of preventive dental care forces reliance on extractions—a permanent loss that affects nutrition, health, and self-esteem.",

Many JCPS students need glasses but can't afford them, harming academic performance. Some schools conduct vision screenings but can't ensure students who need glasses receive them. Several nonprofits provide free glasses to children, but capacity is limited and adult services are minimal.",
        "why_it_matters": "Children can't learn if they can't see the board or their books. Adults can't work effectively or drive safely without vision correction.

These disparities reflect food access, environmental conditions, healthcare access, and stress from economic insecurity. Many Louisville residents with chronic diseases lack consistent primary care for proper management.",
        "why_it_matters": "Poorly managed chronic diseases cause preventable suffering, premature death, and enormous healthcare costs through emergency room visits and hospitalizations.

However, the parks face deferred maintenance, inappropriate development pressures, and unequal investment. Cherokee Park (in affluent Highlands neighborhood) receives significant private donations and attention while Chickasaw Park (in West Louisville) struggles with inadequate maintenance despite equal historic significance. This disparity reflects Louisville's racial and economic geography.",
        "why_it_matters": "The Olmsted Parks are Louisville's crown jewels and should serve all residents equitably.

Total utility costs now consume 8-12% of income for median households and 15-25% for low-income households. Rising utility costs force difficult tradeoffs between heating/cooling, food, medicine, and other necessities.",

West Louisville neighborhoods often have worse drainage than East End, reflecting historic underinvestment in infrastructure.",
        "why_it_matters": "Stormwater management prevents basement flooding, street flooding, and water pollution.

Deferred maintenance affects all Louisville neighborhoods but is most severe in West Louisville where infrastructure investment has been lowest. The longer maintenance is deferred, the more expensive repairs become.",
