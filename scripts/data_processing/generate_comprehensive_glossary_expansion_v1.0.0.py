    {
        "term": "Beat Policing",
        "definition": "A law enforcement strategy where officers are permanently assigned to specific geographic areas (beats) to build relationships with residents, understand local issues, and prevent crime through familiarity and presence.",
        "category": "Public Safety",
        "louisville_context": "Traditional Louisville policing assigns officers to large patrol areas that change frequently, preventing relationship-building. Dave's mini substation model implements true beat policing: 6 officers per substation covering 1-2 square miles permanently. Officers learn resident names, neighborhood dynamics, and recurring problems. This mirrors successful Chicago beat policing that reduced crime 35% in served areas.",
        "why_it_matters": "You can't have community policing without consistent officers. When officers rotate through areas monthly, they're strangers enforcing laws. Beat policing transforms officers into neighbors who prevent problems before they escalate. Trust requires time and consistency.",
        "related_terms": "Mini Police Substation, Community Policing, Neighborhood Policing, Response Time, Crime Prevention",
        "dave_proposal": "All 46 mini substations use beat policing model: officers assigned permanently to neighborhoods, required to attend community meetings, walk beats (not just drive), and build relationships with residents, businesses, and schools."
    },
    {
        "term": "Hot Spot Policing",
        "definition": "Data-driven law enforcement strategy concentrating resources on small geographic areas with disproportionately high crime rates. Typically 5-10% of locations generate 50%+ of all crime.",
        "category": "Public Safety",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville crime concentrates in predictable hot spots: certain West End blocks, parts of the South End, and specific intersections downtown. Current approach spreads officers thinly everywhere. Hot spot policing would concentrate initial mini substations in highest-crime areas: Year 1 deploys 12 substations in neighborhoods with highest violent crime rates, achieving immediate impact where it's needed most.",
        "why_it_matters": "Crime isn't random—it clusters. Putting resources where crime actually happens is both more effective and more equitable. High-crime neighborhoods deserve the most police presence, not the least.",
        "related_terms": "Crime Statistics, CompStat, Predictive Policing, Mini Police Substation, Resource Allocation",
        "dave_proposal": "Year 1 mini substation deployment targets Louisville's highest-crime hot spots first (12 substations in areas with violent crime rates 2x+ city average). Subsequent years expand to moderate-crime and low-crime areas."
    },
    {
        "term": "Clearance Rate",
        "definition": "The percentage of reported crimes that result in an arrest or case closure. Higher clearance rates indicate effective investigation and community cooperation. National average: 45% for violent crimes, 17% for property crimes.",
        "category": "Criminal Justice",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville's clearance rates lag national averages, particularly for shootings in high-crime neighborhoods. Low clearance rates signal to criminals that crimes go unpunished and to victims that reporting is pointless. Mini substations improve clearance rates through: (1) faster response preserves evidence, (2) community trust increases witness cooperation, (3) officers know neighborhood dynamics and suspects.",
        "why_it_matters": "If crimes go unsolved, criminals operate freely and victims lose faith in police. High clearance rates deter crime (criminals know they'll be caught) and build community trust (residents see justice delivered).",
        "related_terms": "Crime Statistics, Investigation, Witness Cooperation, Community Trust, Case Resolution",
        "dave_proposal": "Mini substations improve clearance rates through rapid response (preserving evidence), community relationships (increasing witness cooperation), and officer familiarity with neighborhoods (knowing suspects and patterns)."
    },
    {
        "term": "Use of Force Policy",
        "definition": "Guidelines governing when and how police can use physical force, weapons, or restraints. Includes de-escalation requirements, force continuum (levels of force), prohibited techniques, and accountability measures.",
        "category": "Public Safety",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville's use of force policies came under intense scrutiny after Breonna Taylor's death. Dave's approach: (1) de-escalation training mandatory for all officers, (2) use of force reviewed by civilian board, (3) crisis co-responder teams for mental health calls reduce force incidents, (4) early warning system flags officers with repeated force complaints, (5) transparency through public reporting.",
        "why_it_matters": "How police use force determines whether communities see them as protectors or threats. Clear policies, rigorous training, and accountability build trust while keeping both officers and residents safe.",
        "related_terms": "Police Accountability, De-escalation, Crisis Intervention Team, Civilian Oversight, Body Cameras",
        "dave_proposal": "Strengthen use of force policies: mandatory de-escalation, civilian review of all force incidents, early warning system for officers with repeated complaints, and co-responder teams for mental health crises."
    },
    {
        "term": "Body Cameras",
        "definition": "Wearable video cameras that record police interactions with the public, providing evidence for investigations and accountability. When implemented with clear policies, body cameras reduce complaints against police and use of force incidents.",
        "category": "Public Safety",
        "louisville_context": "LMPD has body cameras but implementation has been inconsistent: officers sometimes don't activate cameras, footage isn't always preserved, and public access is limited. Dave's plan: (1) cameras mandatory and always activated during interactions, (2) tampering with cameras grounds for discipline, (3) footage preserved for all complaints and force incidents, (4) public access process streamlined while protecting privacy.",
        "why_it_matters": "Body cameras protect both police and public when used consistently. They provide objective evidence, discourage misconduct, and build accountability. But only if policies ensure cameras are actually used and footage is accessible.",
        "related_terms": "Police Accountability, Use of Force Policy, Evidence Collection, Transparency, Civilian Oversight",
        "dave_proposal": "Mandate body camera activation for all public interactions, create tamper-proof systems, ensure footage preservation for complaints/incidents, and streamline public access while protecting privacy rights."
    },
    {
        "term": "Early Warning System",
        "definition": "A data-driven tool that tracks officer behavior patterns (use of force, complaints, missed trainings, etc.) to identify officers who may need intervention, retraining, or discipline before serious incidents occur.",
        "category": "Public Safety",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville currently lacks robust early warning systems—problematic officers often have long complaint histories before major incidents. Dave's system would flag officers for: (1) multiple use of force incidents, (2) pattern of civilian complaints, (3) missed de-escalation training, (4) body camera violations. Early intervention includes: retraining, counseling, partnering with veteran officers, or reassignment.",
        "why_it_matters": "Most problem officers show warning signs long before career-ending incidents. Early warning systems catch these patterns and provide intervention before tragedy—protecting both the public and officer careers.",
        "related_terms": "Police Accountability, CompStat, Use of Force Policy, Officer Discipline, Risk Management",
        "dave_proposal": "Implement comprehensive early warning system tracking use of force, complaints, policy violations, and training gaps. Officers flagged receive mandatory intervention (retraining, counseling, monitoring) to prevent serious incidents."
    },
    {
        "term": "Civilian Oversight Board",
        "definition": "An independent body of community members with authority to review police policies, investigate complaints, recommend discipline, and ensure accountability. Effective oversight requires subpoena power and independence from police department.",
        "category": "Government Accountability",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville's current civilian oversight has limited power and resources. Dave's strengthened oversight board will: (1) independent budget and staff, (2) subpoena power for investigations, (3) authority to recommend discipline (binding recommendations), (4) review all use of force incidents, (5) diverse membership representing all Louisville communities, (6) public reporting on findings.",
        "why_it_matters": "Police investigating themselves creates inherent conflicts. Independent civilian oversight provides accountability, builds community trust, and ensures transparency. Effective oversight requires real power, not just advisory roles.",
        "related_terms": "Police Accountability, Transparency, Community Trust, Use of Force Policy, Independent Investigation",
        "dave_proposal": "Create empowered civilian oversight board with independent budget, subpoena power, binding discipline recommendations, use of force review authority, and diverse community representation."
    },
    {
        "term": "Crisis Intervention Team (CIT)",
        "definition": "Specialized police training for responding to mental health crises, emphasizing de-escalation, recognizing mental illness symptoms, and connecting people with treatment rather than jail. Officers receive 40 hours of training from mental health professionals.",
        "category": "Public Safety",
        "louisville_context": "Many Louisville police encounters involve mental health crises, but not all officers have CIT training. Dave's plan: (1) CIT training mandatory for all officers, (2) crisis co-responder teams pair officers with mental health professionals, (3) mobile crisis units respond to mental health calls (not just police), (4) connection to 18 wellness centers for treatment.",
        "why_it_matters": "People in mental health crisis need treatment, not jail. CIT training gives officers skills to de-escalate and connect people with help, reducing use of force, jail bookings, and repeat crises.",
        "related_terms": "Co-Responder Program, Mental Health, De-escalation, Community Wellness Center, Diversion Programs",
        "dave_proposal": "Mandate CIT training for all LMPD officers, deploy co-responder teams pairing officers with mental health professionals, and connect crisis responses to 18 wellness centers for immediate treatment."
    },
    {
        "term": "Co-Responder Program",
        "definition": "Teams pairing police officers with mental health professionals, social workers, or paramedics to respond to crises involving mental illness, addiction, or homelessness. Professional addresses health/social needs while officer ensures safety.",
        "category": "Public Safety",
        "louisville_context": "Based on Denver's STAR program (3,000+ calls, zero arrests, 34% cost savings), Louisville's co-responder teams will respond to mental health crises, addiction emergencies, and welfare checks. Each team: one LMPD officer (CIT-trained) + one licensed mental health professional from wellness centers. Response prioritizes treatment over arrest, with direct connection to services.",
        "why_it_matters": "Police officers aren't mental health professionals, yet 20%+ of 911 calls involve mental health. Co-responder programs provide appropriate response, reduce use of force, avoid unnecessary arrests, and actually help people rather than just processing them through jail.",
        "related_terms": "Crisis Intervention Team, Mental Health, Community Wellness Center, Diversion Programs, De-escalation",
        "dave_proposal": "Deploy co-responder teams throughout Louisville, pairing CIT-trained officers with mental health professionals from 18 wellness centers. Teams respond to mental health crises, connecting people to treatment rather than jail."
    },
    {
        "term": "Recidivism",
        "definition": "The rate at which previously incarcerated people are re-arrested, reconvicted, or re-incarcerated. High recidivism indicates failure to address root causes of crime. Kentucky's 3-year recidivism rate: approximately 40%.",
        "category": "Criminal Justice",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville's recidivism rates mirror Kentucky's: 40% re-arrested within 3 years. Primary drivers: inability to find employment (criminal record), homelessness after release, untreated addiction/mental health, lack of support systems. Dave's approach reduces recidivism through: (1) second chance employment programs, (2) housing assistance for people leaving prison, (3) wellness centers providing addiction/mental health treatment, (4) expungement clinics clearing eligible records.",
        "why_it_matters": "Recidivism means people cycle through prison repeatedly, costing taxpayers while communities stay unsafe. Breaking the cycle requires addressing employment, housing, addiction, and mental health—not just punishment.",
        "related_terms": "Second Chance Employment, Reentry, Criminal Record, Expungement, Addiction Treatment, Recidivism Reduction",
        "dave_proposal": "Reduce recidivism through comprehensive reentry support: second chance hiring by city, housing assistance, addiction/mental health treatment at wellness centers, expungement clinics, and job training programs."
    },
    {
        "term": "Expungement",
        "definition": "Legal process of sealing or destroying criminal records, making past convictions invisible to employers, landlords, and background checks. Eligibility varies by offense type and time passed. Critical for reentry and employment.",
        "category": "Criminal Justice",
        "louisville_context": "Kentucky allows expungement for many non-violent offenses after 5 years, but few Louisville residents know about it or can afford attorney fees ($500-2,000). Dave's plan: (1) free expungement clinics quarterly in each district, (2) partnering with law schools for pro bono representation, (3) city becomes model employer by hiring people with expunged records, (4) public awareness campaign about eligibility.",
        "why_it_matters": "A criminal record is a life sentence of unemployment, housing rejection, and lost opportunities—even for minor offenses from decades ago. Expungement removes barriers, letting people rebuild lives and contribute to society.",
        "related_terms": "Second Chance Employment, Criminal Record, Ban the Box, Reentry, Employment Barriers, Background Check",
        "dave_proposal": "Provide free expungement clinics in all Louisville districts quarterly, partnering with law schools for pro bono legal help. City government becomes model employer for people with expunged records."
    },
    {
        "term": "Ban the Box",
        "definition": "Policy removing criminal history questions from initial job applications (the 'box' asking about convictions), delaying background checks until later in hiring process. Gives applicants with records chance to be evaluated on qualifications first.",
        "category": "Criminal Justice",
        "louisville_context": "Currently, Louisville Metro government and many employers require disclosure of criminal history on initial applications, eliminating candidates before qualifications are considered. Dave's plan: (1) ban-the-box for all city jobs, (2) criminal history considered only after interview, only if job-relevant, (3) incentivize private employers to adopt fair-chance hiring, (4) partnership with Chamber of Commerce on second-chance hiring campaign.",
        "why_it_matters": "The 'box' ensures people with records never get interviews, even for jobs where criminal history is irrelevant. Banning the box lets people be judged on skills and qualifications, not mistakes from years or decades ago.",
        "related_terms": "Second Chance Employment, Expungement, Fair Chance Hiring, Criminal Record, Employment Barriers, Reentry",
        "dave_proposal": "Implement ban-the-box policy for all Louisville Metro government jobs. Criminal history considered only after interview, only if job-relevant. Incentivize private sector adoption through tax credits and recognition."
    },
    {
        "term": "Diversion Programs",
        "definition": "Alternatives to arrest and prosecution that redirect offenders (especially first-time, non-violent) to treatment, education, or community service instead of jail. Reduces recidivism, costs, and criminal record consequences.",
        "category": "Criminal Justice",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville's limited diversion programs miss opportunities to address root causes. Dave expands diversion through: (1) pre-arrest diversion for mental health crises (co-responder teams connect to treatment, not jail), (2) addiction diversion courts connecting to wellness centers, (3) youth diversion programs preventing juvenile records, (4) restorative justice for appropriate offenses.",
        "why_it_matters": "Not every crime requires jail. Addiction, mental illness, and poverty drive many offenses—jail makes these worse, while diversion addresses root causes, reduces costs, and prevents criminal records that destroy futures.",
        "related_terms": "Co-Responder Program, Restorative Justice, Problem-Solving Courts, Community Wellness Center, Recidivism Reduction",
        "dave_proposal": "Expand diversion programs: pre-arrest mental health diversion through co-responders, addiction diversion courts connected to wellness centers, youth diversion preventing juvenile records, and restorative justice options."
    },
    {
        "term": "Restorative Justice",
        "definition": "Approach to crime focusing on repairing harm through dialogue between victims, offenders, and community rather than solely punishment. Emphasizes accountability, understanding impact, and making amends.",
        "category": "Criminal Justice",
        "louisville_context": "Restorative justice works best for property crimes, first-time offenses, and youth offenses where victims want participation. Louisville pilot programs show: 85% victim satisfaction (vs. 30% in traditional court), 33% lower recidivism, and faster resolution. Dave expands restorative justice for appropriate cases, with trained facilitators, voluntary participation, and victim-centered process.",
        "why_it_matters": "Traditional justice system often leaves victims unheard, offenders unchanged, and communities harmed. Restorative justice gives victims voice, holds offenders accountable, repairs relationships, and reduces reoffending.",
        "related_terms": "Diversion Programs, Victim Rights, Community Justice, Accountability, Recidivism Reduction",
        "dave_proposal": "Expand restorative justice for appropriate offenses: trained facilitators, voluntary victim/offender participation, focus on property crimes and first-time offenses, and integration with diversion programs."
    },
    {
        "term": "Juvenile Justice",
        "definition": "Separate legal system for people under 18, emphasizing rehabilitation over punishment. Juvenile records typically sealed at age 18, giving young people second chances. Effectiveness depends on treatment, education, and family support.",
        "category": "Criminal Justice",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville youth crime often results from trauma, poverty, lack of supervision, and limited opportunities. Dave's approach: (1) youth diversion keeping first-time offenders out of system, (2) after-school programs preventing youth violence ($35M investment), (3) youth employment programs (paid jobs for at-risk teens), (4) family support services addressing root causes, (5) trauma-informed juvenile justice.",
        "why_it_matters": "Kids who enter juvenile justice system often end up in adult prisons later. Intervening with treatment, education, and opportunity breaks this pipeline—giving young people futures instead of criminal records.",
        "related_terms": "Youth Violence Prevention, Diversion Programs, After-School Programs, Youth Employment, Trauma-Informed Care",
        "dave_proposal": "Comprehensive juvenile justice reform: diversion for first-time offenders, $35M youth violence prevention programs, paid youth employment, family support services, and trauma-informed system response."

    # ========================================

    {
        "term": "PILOT Program",
        "definition": "Payment In Lieu Of Taxes - tax incentive where businesses make reduced payments instead of full property taxes for a set period (typically 10-20 years). Common economic development tool but controversial without accountability.",
        "category": "Economic Development",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville offers PILOT agreements to attract businesses, particularly industrial/manufacturing. Companies promise jobs and investment, then pay percentage of property taxes (often 50-75% reduction) for 10-20 years. Problem: limited tracking of whether companies deliver promised jobs/wages. Dave requires: (1) wage floors ($15/hr minimum), (2) job creation targets with clawbacks, (3) annual reporting, (4) community benefit agreements.",
        "why_it_matters": "PILOT programs give away millions in tax revenue that could fund schools, police, and services. Without accountability, companies get tax breaks while failing to deliver jobs. Taxpayers deserve to know: are we getting value for tax dollars given away?",
        "related_terms": "TIF District, Tax Abatement, Economic Development Incentive, Clawback Provisions, Job Creation, Community Benefits Agreement",
        "dave_proposal": "All PILOT agreements require: $15/hr minimum wage, job creation targets with clawback provisions, annual public reporting on jobs/wages delivered, and community benefit agreements negotiated with affected neighborhoods."
    },
    {
        "term": "Enterprise Zone",
        "definition": "Designated area where businesses receive tax incentives and regulatory relief to encourage investment in economically distressed neighborhoods. Federal and state programs offer various benefits.",
        "category": "Economic Development",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville has multiple enterprise zones in West Louisville, South End, and other distressed areas. Incentives include: sales tax exemptions on equipment, property tax reductions, and hiring tax credits. Mixed results: some businesses invest, others take incentives without creating quality jobs. Dave requires: (1) living wages for incentive recipients, (2) local hiring requirements, (3) tracking job quality not just quantity.",
        "why_it_matters": "Enterprise zones aim to revitalize poor neighborhoods, but incentives alone don't guarantee good jobs for residents. Without requirements for living wages and local hiring, incentives can subsidize low-wage jobs that don't lift neighborhoods.",
        "related_terms": "Opportunity Zone, Tax Abatement, Economic Development, Job Quality, Local Hiring, Living Wage",
        "dave_proposal": "Strengthen enterprise zone requirements: living wage floor, local hiring preferences, job quality metrics (not just quantity), and accountability for delivering promised community benefits."
    },
    {
        "term": "Opportunity Zone",
        "definition": "Federal tax incentive program allowing investors to defer capital gains taxes by investing in designated low-income areas. Controversial: benefits wealthy investors, limited accountability for community impact.",
        "category": "Economic Development",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville has 24 federally-designated Opportunity Zones, mostly in West Louisville and South End. Intention: attract private investment to distressed areas. Reality: often benefits real estate developers and wealthy investors more than residents. Projects can gentrify neighborhoods without affordable housing or living-wage jobs. Dave requires: (1) community benefits agreements for OZ projects, (2) affordable housing requirements, (3) local hiring mandates, (4) transparency on investments and outcomes.",
        "why_it_matters": "Opportunity Zones can either revitalize neighborhoods or accelerate gentrification. Without community input and requirements for affordable housing and good jobs, OZ investments displace residents rather than lifting them up.",
        "related_terms": "Enterprise Zone, Gentrification, Community Benefits Agreement, Tax Abatement, Affordable Housing, Economic Development",

        "term": "Community Benefits Agreement (CBA)",
        "definition": "Legally-binding contract between developers and community organizations outlining specific benefits the project will provide: local jobs, affordable housing, environmental protections, parks, or services. Gives residents enforcement power.",
        "category": "Economic Development",
        "louisville_context": "Louisville rarely requires CBAs, giving developers incentives without community input. Dave makes CBAs standard for projects receiving: tax incentives over $100,000, TIF districts, zoning variances, or PILOT agreements. CBAs negotiated with affected neighborhood groups, legally binding, and publicly reported. Benefits typically include: local hiring targets, living wages, affordable housing units, environmental protections, and community space.",
        "why_it_matters": "Development affects communities directly—traffic, displacement, jobs, environment. CBAs give residents voice and power to demand benefits, not just accept impacts. Developers get incentives; residents get guarantees.",

Dave's local hiring requirements: (1) city contracts require 20% Louisville residents, (2) projects receiving incentives must hire 30% from affected ZIP codes, (3) partnerships with workforce development programs for training, (4) enforcement through contract compliance monitoring.",
        "why_it_matters": "When development happens in your neighborhood but doesn't hire local residents, it's adding insult to injury—displacement without opportunity. Local hiring ensures community members benefit from their own neighborhood's growth.",

        "category": "Workforce & Labor",
        "louisville_context": "Kentucky has no prevailing wage requirement for state/local projects (repealed 2017), allowing contractors to undercut wages on public projects.

This ensures: quality work, trained workers, living wages, and level playing field for contractors paying fair wages.",

Dave creates incubators in West Louisville, South End, and other areas with: (1) below-market rent for entrepreneurs, (2) shared services (accounting, legal, marketing), (3) mentorship from established business owners, (4) access to small business loans and grants, (5) networking events connecting entrepreneurs to customers and investors, (6) focus on businesses serving neighborhood needs.",
        "why_it_matters": "Small businesses create 65% of new jobs but have high failure rates (50% within 5 years). Incubators dramatically improve success rates by providing support most entrepreneurs can't afford individually. Building neighborhood wealth starts with supporting local entrepreneurs.",

Dave's microenterprise program provides: (1) micro-loans $500-$25,000 with below-market rates, (2) business training in accounting, marketing, legal compliance, (3) technical assistance from experienced entrepreneurs, (4) peer support networks, (5) focus on women, minorities, and low-income entrepreneurs. Examples: home daycares, catering, landscaping, beauty services, handyman services.",

Dave's brownfield program: (1) EPA/state grants for environmental assessment and cleanup, (2) tax incentives for brownfield redevelopment, (3) streamlined permitting, (4) priority for West Louisville and industrial areas, (5) community input on reuse (housing, parks, commercial), (6) job creation requirements.",
