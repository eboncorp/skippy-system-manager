## Budget & Finance

### Appropriation

Money officially allocated by Metro Council for a specific purpose. Once appropriated, departments can spend it. Think of it like Congress approving funding - it's the formal permission to spend taxpayer dollars.

---

### Balanced Budget

Revenue equals expenditures - no deficit spending. Required by law for Louisville. Dave's budget is fully balanced.

---

### Bond

A loan the city takes out for major capital projects (like building a new library). Paid back over many years, similar to a mortgage.

---

### Budget Variance

The difference between what was budgeted and what was actually spent. If we budget $10M for roads and spend $12M, the variance is $2M over. We track this in real-time so you can hold us accountable.

---

### Capital Budget

Money spent on long-term assets like buildings, roads, and equipment that last multiple years. If it lasts longer than one year, it's usually "capital" spending. Building a mini substation is capital; paying the officers who work there is operating.

---

### Capital Outlay

Purchases of equipment, vehicles, or infrastructure that last multiple years. A new fire truck is capital outlay. Gasoline for the fire truck is operating expense.

---

### Community Detective

Police detective assigned to a specific district focused on preventing crime through community relationships, not just solving crimes after they happen. They know the neighborhood, the people, the problems. They build trust before incidents occur.

---

### Community Wellness Center

One-stop facility providing primary healthcare (nurse practitioners), mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, social services navigation, and community programs. Think of it as a neighborhood health hub - not a hospital, but a place where you can get care for the things that often lead to emergencies.

---

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Comparing the costs of a program to its benefits to determine if it's worth the investment. Dave's budget programs all have positive cost-benefit ratios based on evidence from other cities.

---

---

### Debt Ceiling

Legal limit on how much the city can borrow. Set by state law and local ordinance.

---

### Debt Service

Money used to pay back bonds (loans) the city took out for major projects. Like a mortgage payment. Louisville pays approximately $30M/year in debt service for past projects.

---

### Deficit

When spending exceeds revenue. Louisville cannot legally run a deficit in the general fund. Dave's budget has zero deficit.

---

### Evidence-Based Budgeting

Making spending decisions based on proven results from research and other cities' experiences, not political promises or assumptions. Dave's budget is based on outcomes from 50+ cities using similar approaches.

---

### Fire Prevention Centers

Community facilities focused on teaching fire safety, conducting free home inspections, installing smoke detectors, and preventing fires before they start. Especially focused on seniors and high-risk populations.

---

### Fiscal Year (FY)

Louisville's budget year runs from July 1 to June 30. FY 2025-2026 means July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026. It's confusing, but most governments don't use the calendar year for budgets.

---

### Greenberg's Budget

Mayor Greenberg's approved $1.2 billion budget for FY 2025-2026. Traditional approach with centralized services and reactive policing.

---

### Insurance Premium Tax

Tax on insurance policies (auto, home, life, etc.). The state collects it and shares a portion with cities. You don't see this directly - it's built into your insurance premiums.

---

### Intergovernmental Revenue

Money the city receives from state and federal governments, usually through grants. Like when the federal government gives money for roads or community development projects.

---

### Line Item

A specific spending category in the budget (e.g., "Police Officer Salaries" or "Park Maintenance"). The more line items you see, the more transparent the budget. Our budget has 831 line items - most detailed mayoral budget Louisville has ever seen.

---

### Mental Health Crisis Response Team

Social workers or mental health professionals paired with police officers (or responding alone when appropriate) to mental health emergencies. When someone is having a mental health crisis, they need trained counseling, not just law enforcement.

---

### Mini Police Substation

Small neighborhood police office (approximately 5,000 square feet) with officers assigned to walk and bike patrols in the immediate area. Not a traditional distant precinct - more like a neighborhood police post. Officers work out of here and patrol on foot so you see them and know them.

---

### Occupational Tax

Tax on wages earned by people working in Louisville (currently 1.45% for city services, 0.75% for county services = 2.2% total). If you work in Louisville, this comes out of every paycheck whether you live here or not. It's one of the largest revenue sources.

---

### Operating Budget

Money spent on day-to-day operations like salaries, supplies, and services. As opposed to capital spending, these are ongoing costs that recur every year.

---

### Operating Expenses

Day-to-day costs like supplies, utilities, vehicle fuel, and equipment maintenance. Everything that isn't salary or capital. Electricity bills, office supplies, gasoline for patrol cars.

---

### Participatory Budgeting

Democratic process where residents directly vote on how to spend a portion of the public budget. YOU attend community meetings, propose projects, and vote on which ones get funded. Real democracy with real money.

---

### Pension Contributions

Money the city pays into retirement funds for employees. Required by law and contract. Like matching your 401(k), but for public employees. Louisville has significant pension obligations that are fully funded in Dave's budget.

---

### Personnel Costs

Salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes for city employees. Usually 60-70% of most department budgets. This includes health insurance, retirement contributions, and payroll taxes. All city employees keep their jobs in Dave's budget.

---

### Phased Implementation

Rolling out programs gradually over multiple years rather than all at once. Example: Building 12 mini substations in Year 1, then 12 more in Year 2, etc. This ensures quality and sustainability.

---

---

### Prevention-First Approach

Investing in programs that prevent problems (crime, health crises, fires) before they happen, rather than only responding after problems occur. Cheaper and more effective than crisis response.

---

### Property Tax

Annual tax on real estate based on assessed property value. Major source of city revenue. If you own property in Louisville, you pay this. The rate is set by Metro Council and hasn't increased in Dave's budget.

---

### Rainy Day Fund (Reserve Fund)

Money set aside for emergencies, unexpected expenses, or economic downturns. Like your emergency savings account. Financially responsible cities have 10-15% of their budget in reserves. Dave's budget maintains strong reserves while investing in prevention.

---

---

### Return on Investment (ROI)

How much value you get back for money spent. Example: Wellness centers have an ROI of $1.80 saved for every $1 spent.

---

### Surplus

When revenue exceeds spending. Extra money can go to reserves or one-time projects. Dave's budget maintains healthy reserves.

---

### Tax Base

The total value of everything that can be taxed (property, income, sales, etc.). A growing tax base means the city can maintain services with the same tax rate. A shrinking tax base means taxes go up or services get cut.

---

### The Difference

Not the amount (both $1.2B), but HOW it's spent:
- Greenberg: Centralized police precincts → Biggers: 46 neighborhood substations
- Greenberg: Scattered programs → Biggers: 18 consolidated wellness centers
- Greenberg: $63.5M on jails → Biggers: $27M on jails, $36.5M on prevention
- Greenberg: Minimal citizen input → Biggers: $15M participatory budgeting

---

---

### Transfer

Moving money from one fund to another. Sometimes confusing, but it's just internal accounting to get money where it needs to go legally.

---

---

### Youth Development Programs

Consolidated programs including after-school activities (3-7pm - peak crime hours), summer jobs (3,000 positions), mentoring, life skills training, gang intervention, and athletics.

---

## Criminal Justice

### Bail Reform

Reducing reliance on cash bail (where only rich people can afford to leave jail before trial) and using risk assessment instead. Keeps dangerous people locked up, releases low-risk people, saves money.

---

### Co-Responder Model

Police officer + mental health professional responding together to certain calls. Better outcomes, safer for everyone.

---

### Community Policing

Police strategy where officers build relationships with community members through regular positive contact, not just emergency response. The foundation of mini substations.

---

### Conflict Mediation

Community-based dispute resolution that addresses conflicts before they turn violent. Trained mediators help resolve disputes without police or criminal justice involvement.

---

### Diversion Programs

Alternatives to jail for non-violent offenders (treatment, community service, monitoring). More effective than incarceration and much cheaper.

---

### Pre-Trial Detention

Holding someone in jail before their trial. Most people in Louisville Metro Corrections are pre-trial, not convicted criminals.

---

### Recidivism

When someone commits another crime after being released. Prevention programs reduce recidivism rates by addressing root causes.

---

### Street Outreach

Violence interruption teams that work directly with high-risk individuals in communities to prevent conflicts and reduce violence. Trained community members who know the neighborhood and can intervene before situations escalate.

---

### Violence Prevention Programs

Comprehensive approach including street outreach, conflict mediation, trauma support, and community engagement. Addresses root causes of violence through trusted community relationships. Dave's budget allocates $15M for violence prevention citywide.

---

---

## Government Structure

### Executive Branch

The Mayor and departments that implement laws and deliver services. The "doers" of government.

---

### Legislative Branch

Metro Council that makes laws and approves budgets. The "rule-makers" of government.

---

### Metro Council

Louisville's 26-member legislative body that passes laws and approves the budget. Like city council in other cities, but called "Metro Council" because of our city-county merger. 26 districts, each with one council member.

---

### Ordinance

A law passed by Metro Council. The budget is passed as an ordinance each year. If Metro Council passes an ordinance, it becomes law (unless the mayor vetoes it).

---

### Override

When Metro Council votes to pass a law despite the mayor's veto. Requires more votes than the original passage (usually 2/3 or 3/4 of council members).

---

### Public Hearing

Official meeting where citizens can comment on proposed policies or budgets before Metro Council votes. Required by law for budgets and major decisions. This is where YOU get to speak up.

---

### Resolution

A formal statement or decision by Metro Council that doesn't have the force of law. Like a statement of support or a ceremonial recognition.

---

### Transparency

Making government operations, decisions, and budgets open and accessible to the public. Dave's budget is the most transparent in Louisville history - all 831 line items public at rundaverun.org.

---

---

### Veto

The mayor's power to reject an ordinance passed by Metro Council. Council can override a veto with a supermajority vote.

---

## Health & Social Services

### Audit

Independent review of city finances to ensure accuracy and compliance. Annual audits required by law.

---

---

### Community Input

Opportunities for residents to provide feedback on programs and priorities. Monthly community meetings, participatory budgeting, etc.

---

### Community Trust

How much residents trust police and government. Mini substations increase trust by average of 35% in cities using this model.

---

### Competitive Pay

Salaries comparable to private sector jobs or surrounding jurisdictions. Dave's budget brings Louisville Metro salaries in line with surrounding counties and competitive with similar private sector positions. Essential for attracting and retaining quality employees.

---

### Cost Savings

Money saved through prevention vs. crisis response. Wellness centers save $1.80 for every $1 spent. Youth programs save ~$150,000 per youth kept out of juvenile justice system.

---

### Educational Benefits

Programs that help employees pay for college, job training, or professional development. Dave's budget includes tuition assistance for employees pursuing education that advances their career. Helps retain employees and improves workforce quality.

---

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Measurable goals used to track program success. Example: "Reduce violent crime by 15% in Year 2" is a KPI.

---

### Mental Health Services

Counseling, therapy, psychiatric care for mental health conditions. Wellness centers provide this, reducing reliance on emergency rooms and police.

---

### Metrics

Measurements used to assess program effectiveness. Crime rates, ER visit rates, graduation rates, etc.

---

### Performance-Based Compensation

Additional pay or bonuses based on meeting specific goals or demonstrating excellence. Part of comprehensive employee compensation beyond base salary increases. Rewards quality work and incentivizes high performance.

---

### Pilot Program

Small-scale test of a program before full implementation. Some programs may pilot in one district before expanding citywide.

---

### Position Reassignment

Moving employees to different jobs within government without layoffs. Example: Some administrative staff reassigned to wellness centers or community programs. All employees keep their jobs, just in different roles. Often includes training for new position.

---

---

### Preventive Care

Healthcare that prevents disease and identifies problems early (screenings, vaccinations, health education). Saves money long-term.

---

### Primary Care

Basic healthcare (checkups, common illnesses, chronic disease management). Wellness centers provide this through nurse practitioners.

---

### Public Reporting

Regular reports to citizens on program progress and budget status. Quarterly reports proposed.

---

### Questions?

If you don't understand something in the budget, that's OUR failure, not yours. Email info@rundaverun.org with questions and we'll update this glossary.

---

### Rollout Strategy

Plan for gradually implementing new programs. Starts with highest-need areas, expands systematically.

---

### Scaling Up

Expanding a successful program from small to large. Example: Starting with 12 substations in Year 1, scaling to 46 by Year 4.

---

---

### Service Quality Metrics

Measurable standards for how well government services are delivered. Examples: Average response times, customer satisfaction ratings, facility cleanliness scores, program completion rates. Dave's budget includes tracking service quality across all departments and publishing results on public dashboard.

---

---

### Social Services Navigation

Helping people access programs they qualify for (food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, job training). Wellness centers help residents navigate the system.

---

### Substance Abuse Treatment

Medical and counseling services for addiction. Much more effective and cheaper than jail for non-violent drug offenses.

---

### Transparency Dashboard

Public website showing real-time budget data, program outcomes, and spending. Dave commits to creating this.

---

### Trauma Support

Counseling and services for individuals who have experienced violence, abuse, or other traumatic events. Part of violence prevention programs - addressing trauma prevents cycle of violence.

---

---

### Trauma-Informed Care

Approach that recognizes how trauma affects people and provides appropriate support. Especially important for youth programs and violence intervention.

---

### Turnover Rate

Percentage of employees who leave their jobs each year. High turnover costs money in recruitment and training. Louisville currently loses experienced employees to better-paying jobs in surrounding areas. Competitive pay reduces turnover by 35-50%.

---

### Workplace Protections

Employee rights including fair treatment, due process, protection from discrimination, safe working conditions, and clear grievance procedures. Dave's Employee Bill of Rights guarantees comprehensive workplace protections for all Metro employees.
