# Voter Education Glossary Enhancement Analysis
## Integrating 400+ Terms with Current Policy Documents

**Campaign:** Run Dave Run - Louisville Mayor 2026  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Strategic analysis of how the comprehensive voter education glossary can enhance and strengthen existing policy documents

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Your voter education glossary (400+ terms) and policy documents (Budget 3.0, implementation guides, campaign materials) are powerful individually but **transformative when integrated**. This analysis shows exactly how to leverage the glossary to:

1. **Strengthen policy credibility** - Link every claim to defined terms
2. **Improve accessibility** - Make complex policies understandable
3. **Create unified messaging** - Consistent language across all materials
4. **Build voter education** - Transform campaign into civic literacy project
5. **Differentiate from opponents** - Show depth of understanding

---

## PART 1: CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### What You Have: Policy Documents

- Executive Budget Summary ($1.2B)
- Our Plan for Louisville (Detailed Breakdown)
- Budget Glossary (existing but limited)
- Budget Implementation Roadmap
- Participatory Budgeting Guide
- Day in the Life scenarios

**Campaign Materials:**

- Cross-references showing policy interconnections
- Evidence-based definitions with local data
- Equity lens throughout

---

## PART 2: INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Opportunity 1: Hyperlinked Policy Documents

**Current State:**
Your Budget 3.0 documents use technical terms without definitions. Readers may not understand:
- Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
- PILOT agreements
- Participatory Budgeting
- Community Benefits Agreements
- Clawback Provisions

**Enhanced State:**
Every technical term in policy documents becomes a hyperlink to glossary:

**Example from Budget 3.0:**
BEFORE:
> "We propose participatory budgeting for $25M annually, with community benefits agreements required for all economic development incentives."

AFTER:
> "We propose [participatory budgeting](glossary/participatory-budgeting) for $25M annually, with [community benefits agreements](glossary/community-benefits-agreement) required for all economic development incentives."

**Impact:**
- Voters can instantly learn what terms mean
- Increases document accessibility
- Shows depth without overwhelming readers
- Builds credibility through transparency

**Implementation:**
1. Identify all technical terms in each policy document
2. Link to corresponding glossary entries
3. Ensure glossary has every term referenced
4. Test links before publication

---

### Opportunity 2: Expanded Budget Glossary

**Current State:**
Budget 3.0 has a basic glossary but it's limited.

**Enhancement Strategy:**
**Replace** limited budget glossary with full 95-term Budget & Finance category from voter education glossary:

**New Terms to Add:**
From your comprehensive glossary:
- General Fund vs. Enterprise Funds
- Revenue Sources (all types)
- Tax structures (occupational, property, insurance)
- Budget process terms
- Fiscal accountability measures
- Transparency mechanisms

**Example Enhanced Entry:**

**CURRENT (limited):**
> **Property Tax:** Tax on real estate owned in Louisville Metro

**ENHANCED (from glossary):**
> **Property Tax**
> 
> **Definition:** Annual tax on real estate (land and buildings) based on assessed value. Property owners pay based on the value of their property as determined by the Property Valuation Administrator (PVA).
> 
> **Louisville Context:**
> - **Current Rate:** $0.769 per $100 of assessed value (city portion)
> - **Revenue:** ~$116M annually for city services
> - **Who Pays:** Property owners (homeowners, businesses, landlords)
> - **Assessment:** Based on 100% of fair market value
> - **Exemptions:** Homestead exemption ($43,200 for owner-occupied), non-profit exemptions
> 
> **How It Works:**
> PVA assesses property values → Metro Council sets tax rate → Revenue Commissioncollects taxes → Funds city services like police, fire, parks
> 
> **Why It Matters:**
> Property tax is the second-largest local revenue source. Understanding how it's calculated helps evaluate budget proposals and their impact on homeowners versus renters.
> 
> **Related Terms:** Tax Rate, Assessed Value, Homestead Exemption, Revenue Sources

**Impact:**
- Voters understand budget terminology
- Links budget to comprehensive glossary
- Shows command of public finance
- Educational resource beyond campaign

---

### Opportunity 3: "Learn More" Sections in Campaign Materials

**Current State:**
Campaign materials use abbreviated language for quick reading.

**Enhancement Strategy:**
Add "Learn More" boxes linking to glossary for deeper understanding.

**Example from Door-to-Door Talking Points:**

**CURRENT:**
> "Dave's plan includes 46 mini police substations for community policing"

**ENHANCED:**
> "Dave's plan includes 46 mini police substations for community policing"
> 
> **[📚 Learn More: What is Community Policing?](glossary/community-policing)**
> **[📚 Learn More: How Do Mini Substations Work?](glossary/mini-substations)**

**Impact:**
- Keeps campaign materials brief
- Provides path for interested voters
- Builds deeper understanding
- Shows you welcome scrutiny

---

### Opportunity 4: Policy Document "Glossary Check"

**Current Problem:**
Policy documents may use terms inconsistently or without definition.

**Solution:**
Run every policy document through "glossary audit":

**Audit Process:**
1. Extract all policy-specific terms from document
2. Check if term exists in glossary
3. If YES: Add hyperlink
4. If NO: Add term to glossary
5. Ensure consistent usage across all documents

**Example Audit Results:**

**Budget 3.0 Executive Summary - Terms Found:**
✅ In Glossary:
- Participatory Budgeting
- Community Policing
- Living Wage
- Environmental Justice
- Clawback Provisions
- Evidence-Based Policy

❌ Missing from Glossary:
- "Budget-Neutral" (add to glossary)
- "Public Safety Infrastructure" (add to glossary)
- "Community Wellness Model" (add to glossary)

**Action:** Add missing terms to glossary

**Impact:**
- Comprehensive coverage
- No gaps in understanding
- Professional consistency
- Credibility through completeness

---

### Opportunity 5: Campaign Messaging Framework

**Current Challenge:**
Multiple people create campaign materials - risk of inconsistent terminology.

**Solution:**
Use glossary as authoritative source for ALL campaign language.

**Create "Preferred Terms Guide":**

| Policy Area | USE This Term | DON'T USE | Glossary Link |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Public Safety | Community Policing | Cops on Beats | [Link] |
| Budget | Participatory Budgeting | Community Input | [Link] |
| Economics | Living Wage | Fair Pay | [Link] |
| Housing | Affordable Housing | Low-Income Housing | [Link] |
| Environment | Environmental Justice | Green Policy | [Link] |

**Impact:**
- Consistent messaging
- Professional communication
- Unified brand voice
- Easy training for volunteers

---

### Opportunity 6: Opposition Research Defense

**Current State:**
Opposition will attack your policies - you need strong defenses.

**Enhancement:**
Use glossary to pre-emptively define terms favorably and educate voters before attacks come.

**Example: Anticipating "Defund the Police" Attack**

**Without Glossary:**
Opposition claims: "Dave wants to defund the police!"
You respond: "No I don't! I'm adding funding!"
(Defensive, reactive)

**With Glossary:**
**Glossary Entry "Community Policing" educates voters BEFORE attacks:**
> Community policing emphasizes building relationships between officers and neighborhoods they serve through increased presence, accessibility, and accountability. This is NOT about reducing police presence - it's about making policing more effective through trust-building and problem-solving partnerships.
>
> **What Community Policing Is:**
> - More officers in neighborhoods (mini substations)
> - Officers walking beats, knowing residents
> - Problem-solving partnerships
> - Accountability to community
>
> **What Community Policing Is NOT:**
> - Reducing police presence
> - Eliminating law enforcement
> - "Defunding the police"
> - Soft on crime

When opposition attacks, voters already know the real definition. You're educating, not defending.

**Impact:**
- Proactive vs. reactive
- Voter education neutralizes attacks
- Credibility through transparency
- Forces opponents to attack education
