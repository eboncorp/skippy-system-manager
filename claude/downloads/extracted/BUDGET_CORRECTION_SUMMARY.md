## WHY THIS MATTERS

### Political Impact

**If we had distributed materials with $898.8M:**
❌ Understated budget by $126.2 million (12% error)
❌ Opposition: "Biggers doesn't know the actual budget!"
❌ Media: "Candidate claims smaller budget than reality"
❌ Voters: "Can't trust his numbers"
❌ **Campaign credibility damaged**

**With correct $1.025 billion:**
✅ Matches official budget exactly
✅ Shows attention to detail
✅ Demonstrates competence
✅ Withstands fact-checking
✅ **Campaign credibility intact**
