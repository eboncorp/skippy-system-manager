## üé® CUSTOMIZATION

### Change Colors to Match Your Brand:

Edit `glossary-styles.css`:

```css
.glossary-term {
    color: #YOUR-BRAND-COLOR;
    border-bottom-color: #YOUR-BRAND-COLOR;
}

.glossary-term::after {
    background-color: #YOUR-DARK-COLOR;
}
```

### Change Tooltip Size:

```css
.glossary-term::after {
    width: 350px;  /* Make wider */
    font-size: 15px;  /* Make larger text */
}
```

### Disable Mobile Click Mode (Keep Hover Only):

Edit `glossary-interactive.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    // ... other settings ...
    mobileBreakpoint: 0,  /* Disable click mode */
};
```

---

## üìä ANALYTICS TRACKING

The system automatically tracks which glossary terms voters view most. This helps you:

1. **Identify confusing terms** - Terms viewed most often may need clearer messaging
2. **Refine talking points** - Focus volunteer training on most-viewed terms
3. **Improve content** - Add more context where voters need it

### View Stats in Browser Console:

```javascript
getGlossaryStats()  // Shows most-viewed terms
```

### Track in Google Analytics:

Events are automatically sent as:
- Event Category: "Glossary"
- Event Action: "View"
- Event Label: [term name]

View in GA: **Behavior ‚Üí Events ‚Üí Top Events ‚Üí Glossary**

## üí° BEST PRACTICES

### Do's:
‚úÖ Link terms on FIRST occurrence in each document  
‚úÖ Use clear, concise definitions (1-3 sentences)  
‚úÖ Include Louisville-specific context  
‚úÖ Test on real voters - ask for feedback  
‚úÖ Track which terms are viewed most  
‚úÖ Update definitions as campaign evolves  

### Don'ts:
‚ùå Don't link the same term multiple times on one page  
‚ùå Don't use jargon in the definitions themselves  
‚ùå Don't make tooltips too long (300 char max)  
‚ùå Don't forget to test on mobile  
‚ùå Don't link terms voters already understand well  

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Tooltips not appearing"
- Check that CSS file is loaded (View Source ‚Üí look for glossary-styles.css)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify HTML structure is correct (`<span class="glossary-term">`)

### "Tooltips cut off on mobile"
- CSS automatically positions tooltips to stay on screen
- May need to adjust `width` property for very small screens

### "Analytics not tracking"
- Verify Google Analytics is installed
- Check console for "Glossary term viewed:" messages
- May need to update GA tracking ID

### "WordPress plugin conflicts"
- Try disabling other plugins one by one
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- May need to adjust CSS z-index for tooltips

---

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

Track these to measure glossary effectiveness:

### Quantitative:
- **Pageviews on glossary page** - Are voters finding it?
- **Time on page** - Are they reading definitions?
- **Most-viewed terms** - What confuses voters most?
- **Mobile vs desktop usage** - Optimize for actual usage

### Qualitative:
- **Volunteer feedback** - "Glossary helped me explain X"
- **Voter questions** - Are they asking about terms less?
- **Media coverage** - Are reporters using glossary?
- **Opposition attacks** - Can't claim you're unclear
