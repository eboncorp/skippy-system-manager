## THE TRANSFORMATION

### BEFORE: Standard Policy Document

```markdown
Dave Biggers' Louisville:
- Invests $100M in democratic governance and community power
- Puts 46 mini substations in neighborhoods with officers on foot
- Gives YOU a vote on $1.5M in neighborhood spending
- Prevents problems before they start
```

**User Experience:**
- Reads "democratic governance" → unsure what it means
- Sees "mini substations" → doesn't know how it differs from regular police
- Encounters "participatory budgeting" → might guess, might not
- **Result:** Understands surface, misses depth

---

### AFTER: Glossary-Enhanced Document

```markdown
Dave Biggers' Louisville:
- Invests $100M in [democratic governance](/glossary/democratic-governance/) and community power
- Puts 46 [mini substations](/glossary/mini-substation/) in neighborhoods with officers on foot
- Gives YOU a vote on $1.5M in neighborhood spending through [participatory budgeting](/glossary/participatory-budgeting/)
- Prevents problems before they start with [prevention-first policing](/glossary/prevention-first-policing/)
```

**User Experience:**
- Sees **bold underlined** terms → knows they're clickable
- Clicks "mini substations" → gets full explanation
- Reads: "Small neighborhood police station (200-1,500 sq ft) serving a specific area (5-10 sq miles) with 4-8 officers who know the community personally..."
- Returns to document with full understanding
- **Result:** Deep comprehension, informed evaluation

## REAL EXAMPLE: Mini Substation Definition

### What Voter Sees When They Click:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MINI SUBSTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DEFINITION:
A small, neighborhood-based police station (typically 200-1,500 square feet) 
that serves a specific geographic area (usually 5-10 square miles) with a 
dedicated team of 4-8 officers who know the community personally and focus 
on prevention, relationship-building, and problem-solving rather than just 
responding to 911 calls.

LOUISVILLE CONTEXT:
Currently, Louisville Metro Police operates primarily from 2 large precincts:
- 1st Division (downtown)
- 2nd Division (South Louisville)

Problem: Officers patrol large areas from distant stations, rarely seeing 
same neighborhoods consistently, making community relationships difficult.

Solution: 46 mini substations strategically placed across all 6 districts, 
ensuring every neighborhood has nearby, visible, accessible police presence.

WHY IT MATTERS:
When officers work from mini substations, they:
• Walk/bike patrol the same streets daily
• Know residents, business owners, community leaders by name
• Identify problems before they escalate
• Build trust through consistent presence
• Respond faster (already in neighborhood)
• Prevent crime rather than just respond to it

EVIDENCE:
Cities with mini substations see:
• 18-35% reduction in violent crime (LA, Newark, Boston)
• 22% faster emergency response times (San Diego)
• 40% increase in community trust (Chicago)
• 63% reduction in youth crime in covered areas (Boston)

COST:
• Setup: $150,000-200,000 per substation (lease, basic equipment)
• Annual operating: $300,000-350,000 per substation (4-8 officers' salaries)
• Louisville plan: 46 substations over 4 years = $8M capital, ongoing operating costs

RELATED TERMS:
→ Community Policing
→ Prevention-First Policing  
→ Patrol Operations
→ Geographic Accountability
→ Community Detective

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Impact:** Voter now understands not just WHAT (mini stations) but WHY (community relationships), HOW (dedicated officers), and WHETHER IT WORKS (evidence from other cities).

## STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES

### 1. CREDIBILITY BOOST

**Without Glossary:**
> "I promise 46 mini substations across Louisville."

**Voter Reaction:** *"What's a mini substation? Sounds like fancy talk for police presence. Probably can't afford it anyway."*

**With Glossary:**
> "I promise 46 [mini substations](/glossary/mini-substation/) across Louisville."
> → Click →
> "Mini substations are small neighborhood police stations (200-1,500 sq ft) with 4-8 dedicated officers who patrol on foot and bike, building relationships before problems occur. Evidence from Boston, LA, and Newark shows 18-35% crime reduction. Cost: $8M over 4 years, funded by reallocating police administrative overhead from $17M to $5.6M."

**Voter Reaction:** *"Wow, they've really thought this through. Specific numbers, evidence from other cities, clear funding source. This person knows what they're talking about."*

### 3. VOTER EMPOWERMENT

## SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Budget Term

**Term in Document:** "capital expenditure"

**Without Link:**
Voter reads "$8M capital expenditure for mini substations"
- Thinks: *"Is that yearly? One-time? What does capital mean?"*
- Might Google it, might not
- Likely moves on confused

**With Link:**
Voter clicks [capital expenditure](/glossary/capital-expenditure/)
- Reads: "One-time cost for assets lasting 5+ years (buildings, equipment, infrastructure) vs. operating expenses (salaries, supplies) that recur annually. In Louisville Metro budget, capital expenditures come from Capital Fund or bond proceeds, not General Fund used for operations."
- Thinks: *"Oh, so the $8M is one-time construction cost, not yearly expense. That's actually reasonable."*
- Returns to document with understanding

---

### Example 2: Policy Term

**Term in Document:** "community benefit agreement"

**Without Link:**
Voter reads "All projects over $5M must have community benefit agreements"
- Thinks: *"Sounds nice, but what does that actually mean?"*
- Assumes vague PR promise
- Continues reading skeptically

**With Link:**
Voter clicks [community benefit agreement](/glossary/community-benefit-agreement/)
- Reads: "Legally enforceable contract between developer and community requiring specific benefits: local hiring percentages (20-50%), living wage requirements ($15-20/hr), affordable housing units (10-25%), environmental protections, community facilities access. If developer fails to meet commitments, contract can be voided or penalties enforced. Used successfully in Louisville's Whiskey Row project, LA's Staples Center, Boston's One Kendall Square."
- Thinks: *"This is a real policy with teeth, not just talk. They've done the research. This could actually hold developers accountable."*
- Returns to document trusting candidate

---

### Example 3: Program Term

**Term in Document:** "violence interruption"

**Without Link:**
Voter reads "$5M for community violence interruption programs"
- Thinks: *"What is violence interruption? Sounds made up."*
- Skeptical about effectiveness
- Questions if money is wasted

**With Link:**
Voter clicks [violence interruption](/glossary/violence-interruption/)
- Reads: "Public health approach treating violence as contagious disease. Trained 'violence interrupters' (often former gang members) identify conflicts before escalation, mediate disputes, connect high-risk individuals with services. Cure Violence model used in 70+ US cities. Evidence: Chicago saw 63% reduction in shootings in program areas. NYC reduced youth gun injuries by 50% in 3 years. Cost-effective: $1 invested saves $17 in incarceration/healthcare costs."
- Thinks: *"This is a real, proven program with serious research behind it. Not some random idea. Evidence shows it works and saves money long-term."*
- Returns to document as supporter
