    "term": "Mini Police Substation",
    "definition": "A small, neighborhood-based police facility staffed with 6 officers working rotating shifts to provide 24/7 local presence. Unlike traditional precincts that cover huge areas, mini substations embed officers directly in the communities they serve, typically covering 1-2 square miles or 10,000-15,000 residents.",
    "category": "Public Safety",
    "louisville_context": "Dave's plan calls for mini substations (at least one in every ZIP code) across Louisville Metro, one for each ZIP code area, at a total cost of $47.5 million over 4 years (budgeted for up to 73 substations to cover all Louisville ZIP codes). Each substation costs approximately $650,000 annually to operate (officer salaries, facility lease, equipment). Evidence from Chicago shows mini substations reduce crime by 35% in served areas and improve police-community relations by 40%.",
    "why_it_matters": "Traditional policing spreads officers too thin—one officer might cover 15 square miles. Mini substations mean you know your neighborhood officers by name, they know local issues, and response times drop from 20-30 minutes to 2-3 minutes. This is community policing that actually works.",
    "related_terms": "Community Policing, Response Time, Beat Cop, Neighborhood Policing, Crime Prevention",
    "dave_proposal": "Deploy mini substations (at least one in every ZIP code) over 4 years: Year 1 (12 substations in highest-crime areas), Year 2 (12 more), Year 3 (12 more), Year 4 (10 final substations). Each staffed with 6 officers providing 24/7 coverage. Total annual operating cost: $29.9M from reallocated public safety budget."

    "term": "Response Time",
    "definition": "The time between when a 911 call is placed and when police/fire/EMS arrive on scene. Measured separately for Priority 1 (life-threatening emergencies), Priority 2 (serious but not life-threatening), and Priority 3 (non-emergency) calls.",
    "category": "Public Safety",
    "louisville_context": "Current Louisville Metro response times average 12-15 minutes for Priority 1 calls in high-crime areas, with some neighborhoods waiting 20-30 minutes. In Chicago neighborhoods with mini substations, response times dropped to an average of 2-3 minutes. Fast response times are critical for violent crimes, medical emergencies, and hot pursuit situations.",
    "why_it_matters": "Every minute matters in emergencies. The difference between a 2-minute and 20-minute response can be life or death in a shooting, heart attack, or home invasion. Slow response times also signal to criminals that they have time to escape, increasing crime rates.",

    "louisville_context": "Dave's plan creates 18 wellness centers across Louisville Metro, strategically located in underserved neighborhoods. Each center provides: mental health counseling, addiction treatment, primary care, dental services, prescription assistance, job training referrals, and social work support. Modeled on successful programs in San Antonio and Denver that reduced emergency room visits by 30% and homelessness by 25%.",
    "why_it_matters": "Right now, people in crisis have nowhere to go except the emergency room or jail. A single ER visit for a mental health crisis costs $2,000-5,000. Treating that same person at a wellness center costs $200-500 and actually addresses root causes. This is both compassionate and cost-effective.",

    "louisville_context": "Dave's plan dedicates $15 million annually to participatory budgeting, divided among Louisville's districts. Residents can propose and vote on projects like playground improvements, street lighting, community gardens, sidewalk repairs, and neighborhood beautification. Process includes: proposal phase (residents submit ideas), review phase (staff evaluate feasibility and cost), vote phase (residents vote on final projects).",
    "why_it_matters": "Most people feel like government doesn't listen. Participatory budgeting gives you actual control over how tax dollars are spent in your neighborhood. Cities using this approach see civic engagement increase by 50% and resident satisfaction with government double.",

It uses the exact same total budget as current administration ($1.025B) but reallocates spending to proven priorities: mini substations, wellness centers, fire prevention, participatory budgeting. Funded through: eliminating duplicative programs, reducing administrative overhead, competitive bidding on contracts, and federal grant matches.",
    "why_it_matters": "Politicians often say 'we can't afford that.' Dave proves you can fund transformative change without raising taxes—it's about priorities, not just money. Budget-neutral means fiscally responsible while still delivering results.",

Dave's plan creates dedicated fire prevention centers that provide: free smoke detector installation, home safety inspections, escape plan creation, fire safety education for schools, and proactive outreach to vulnerable residents. Evidence from cities with prevention programs shows 40-60% reduction in fire deaths.",

    "category": "Economic Development",
    "louisville_context": "Louisville offers hundreds of millions in development incentives annually, but often lacks accountability. Companies receive tax breaks but don't always deliver promised jobs or wages. Dave's plan requires: job creation minimums, wage requirements ($15/hr+), clawback provisions if promises aren't met, and public reporting on outcomes.",
    "why_it_matters": "Incentives can create jobs and growth—or they can be corporate welfare with no public benefit. The difference is accountability.

Dave's plan makes clawbacks standard in all economic development deals: miss job targets by more than 10%? Repay proportional incentives. Close facility within 5 years? Repay all incentives. Pay below promised wages? Forfeit future tax breaks.",
    "why_it_matters": "Without clawbacks, companies have zero accountability after getting tax breaks. They can promise 500 jobs, deliver 100, and keep all the incentives. Clawbacks ensure companies keep their promises or pay back taxpayers.",

Kentucky minimum wage is just $7.25/hour—less than half what's needed. An estimated 40-50% of Louisville workers earn below living wage, forcing reliance on public assistance even while working full-time.",

    "definition": "A development tool where future property tax increases from a project are used to finance current improvements. The area is designated a TIF district, and the 'increment' (tax increase from new development) goes back into the district rather than the general fund for a set period (usually 20-30 years).",
    "category": "Budget & Finance",
    "louisville_context": "Louisville has dozens of TIF districts, diverting millions in property tax growth away from schools, police, and other services. While TIFs can spur development, they're often approved for areas that would develop anyway—essentially giving away future tax revenue. Dave's plan requires: (1) TIFs only for truly blighted areas, (2) sunset provisions (TIFs expire after 20 years), (3) public benefit requirements (affordable housing, living wages), (4) annual reporting on tax revenue diverted.",
    "why_it_matters": "TIFs sound technical but they're huge: they can divert $50-100 million over 20 years away from schools and services. Developers love TIFs because they shift costs to taxpayers. Without accountability, TIFs become corporate welfare disguised as development tools.",
