## CORE PERSUASION SCRIPTS

### For Undecided Voters

**Discovery Question:**
"Are you familiar with Dave Biggers and what he's accomplished for our community?"

**If NO:**
"Dave's been incredible for our neighborhoods. In just 4 years, he:
- Hired 46 new neighborhood officers - crime is down 23%
- Invested $55 MILLION in education - our kids finally have the resources they deserve
- Built 18 mental health centers across the city
- Created a $15 million participatory budget where YOU get to vote on how money is spent

He doesn't just promise change, he delivers it. Can Dave count on your vote on November 5th?"

**If YES:**
"That's great! What matters most to you - public safety, education, mental health, or community participation?"

**Then match their priority:**

**Public Safety:**
"Dave gets it. He hired 46 neighborhood officers who actually know our streets and build relationships. Not just patrols - real community policing. Crime is down 23% in areas with his officers. The current mayor promised 100 officers and only delivered 23. Dave keeps his promises."

**Education:**
"Our schools were struggling. The current mayor cut $12 million from education while saying 'Education First.' Dave invested $55 million. New computers in every classroom. Teachers got raises. After-school programs are fully funded. And test scores are up 15%. That's real investment in our kids."

**Mental Health:**
"Mental health matters. Dave built 18 mental health centers across the city. Real facilities with real counselors providing real help. Over 12,000 people got services last year. That's 12,000 neighbors who got the support they needed. This isn't talk - it's action."

**Community Voice:**
"Dave created a $15 million participatory budget. That means YOU vote on how that money gets spent in OUR neighborhoods. Playgrounds, street lights, community gardens - residents decide. Meanwhile, the current mayor cut town halls from 26 to just 4 per year. Dave believes government should listen to the people, not ignore them."

**Close:**
"Can Dave count on your support on November 5th?"

### For Soft Supporters (Leaning Dave)

**Opening:**
"Great to hear you're supporting Dave! His track record really speaks for itself. Have you made your plan to vote on November 5th?"

**If YES:**
"Fantastic! Can we count on you to bring a friend or family member with you? Every vote matters in this race."

**If NO:**
"No problem! Let me give you all the details. Your polling place is [check address/give info]. Polls are open from [time] to [time]. What time works best for you to vote?"

**Volunteer Ask:**
"You know what would be amazing? We need volunteers like you to help reach more neighbors. Could you spare [2 hours/one evening] to help us knock on doors or make calls? It's actually pretty fun and you meet great people!"

**If INTERESTED:**
"Perfect! Let me take your contact info and our volunteer coordinator will reach out. [Collect name, phone, email]"

**If NOT NOW:**
"No worries! Can you help by putting a yard sign up? Or sharing Dave's posts on social media? Every little bit helps!"

---

### For Opponent Supporters

**Respectful Approach:**
"I appreciate you being engaged in the process - that's what democracy is about! Can I ask what issues are most important to you?"

**Listen, then respond:**
"Those are important issues. Here's what Dave's actually accomplished on [their issue]..."

**Share one or two specific facts, then:**

"I know you've made your decision, and I respect that. But if you're open to learning more about Dave's record, here's our website. Either way, I hope you'll vote on November 5th. Thanks for your time!"

**DO NOT:**
- Argue
- Criticize their candidate
- Get defensive
- Spend more than 2-3 minutes
- Try to force a conversion

**Move on gracefully.**

---

### For Non-Voters

**Discovery:**
"Are you planning to vote in the November 5th election?"

**If "NO" or "MAYBE":**
"I totally get it - local elections can feel less exciting. But here's why this one matters: [Pick their likely concern]

- If they mention crime: "Crime affects all of us. Dave's neighborhood officers have made real improvements. Your vote keeps that going."
- If they mention schools: "Our kids' future is on the ballot. Dave invested $55M in education. That only continues if he's re-elected."
- If they're frustrated with politics: "I get the frustration! That's actually why Dave's different - he actually delivers results, not promises. Give him a chance?"

Your vote literally shapes your neighborhood's future. Can we count on you to show up on November 5th?"

**Registration Help:**
"Are you registered to vote? If not, I can help you right now - it takes 2 minutes on your phone."

## DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS

### Hostile/Angry Voter

**Stay Calm:**
"I hear your frustration, and those are valid concerns. Can I share some information that might address them?"

**If they continue being hostile:**
"I understand this is a passionate topic. I don't want to take up more of your time, but if you'd like to learn more about Dave's positions, here's our website. Thanks for talking with me."

**Leave politely. Don't escalate.**

### Misinformation

**Gentle Correction:**
"You know, I've actually heard that too, but it turns out that's not accurate. Here's what really happened: [FACTS with source if possible]"

**If they insist:**
"I hear you, but I'd encourage you to check [reliable source]. Either way, appreciate your time!"

### Single-Issue Voter (Issue we disagree on)

**Acknowledge:**
"I understand that's important to you. While Dave may see that issue differently, here's where you might agree with him: [Find common ground on different issue]"

**If no common ground:**
"I respect your position on that. Thanks for hearing me out. Have a good day!"
