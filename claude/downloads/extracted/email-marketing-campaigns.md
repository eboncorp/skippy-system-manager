## CAMPAIGN 1: WELCOME SERIES (New Supporters)

### Email 1.1: Welcome & Thank You (Send immediately)
**Subject:** Welcome to the movement, [First Name]!
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

Hi [First Name],

Thank you for joining our campaign! I'm Dave Biggers, and I'm running for mayor because our city deserves leadership that actually delivers results.

I'm not like the current mayor who makes big promises and breaks them. I've already proven what I can do:
- 46 new neighborhood officers keeping our streets safe
- $55M invested in our schools
- 18 mental health crisis centers saving lives
- $15M participatory budget where YOU decide how tax dollars are spent

This campaign isn't about me - it's about us. Together, we're going to build a city that works for everyone.

Here's what you can expect from me:
‚úì Weekly updates on our campaign progress
‚úì Invitations to town halls and community events
‚úì Ways to get involved (as much or as little as you want)
‚úì The truth about what's happening in our city

Want to dive deeper? Check out these resources:
‚Üí Our full policy platform: rundaverun.org/policies

Dave

P.S. - Hit reply to this email anytime. I read every message, and I personally respond to as many as I can.

### Email 1.2: Our Story (Day 2)
**Subject:** Why I'm running (it's personal)
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

People ask me why I'm running for mayor. The honest answer? I'm tired of seeing our community's potential wasted.

I grew up in [District Name]. My mom worked two jobs to keep us afloat. I saw what happens when leaders forget about neighborhoods like ours.

When I first got involved in local government, I made a promise: I'd never forget where I came from, and I'd never stop fighting for families like mine.

That's why I pushed for:
- Neighborhood officers who know your name
- Free after-school programs for working families
- Mental health centers instead of just more police
- Letting residents vote on how $15M gets spent

The current mayor? He promised 100 new officers and hired 23. He promised "Education First" and cut $12M from schools. He promised monthly town halls and held 4 in an entire year.

I'm running because promises without action aren't leadership - they're betrayal.

Our campaign is powered by people, not corporate PACs. We're taking on the establishment, and we're going to win - but only if we do it together.

Will you help us?

Thank you for believing in what we can accomplish together.

### Email 1.3: How You Can Help (Day 4)
**Subject:** 3 ways you can help (choose what works for you)
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

Hey [First Name],

I want to make something clear: there's no "wrong" way to support this campaign.

Some people can give money. Some have time. Some just share on social media. All of it matters. All of it helps.

Here are three ways you can help right now - pick what works for you:

**üí∞ OPTION 1: CHIP IN $25**
Your $25 provides yard signs for 5 neighbors. That's 5 more people telling our city: we deserve better.
‚Üí Donate here: [LINK]

**üö™ OPTION 2: KNOCK 100 DOORS**
Just 2 hours on a Saturday. We provide training, walking lists, and snacks. You provide the conversation.
‚Üí Sign up here: [LINK]

**üì± OPTION 3: SHARE OUR MESSAGE**
Follow us, share our posts, tell your story. Social media is how we reach voters who don't watch TV.
‚Üí Follow us: [SOCIAL LINKS]

Can't do any of these? No problem! Forward this email to 3 friends who care about our city.

Every action adds up. Every person matters. Including you.

Let's do this,
Dave

### Email 1.4: Town Hall Invitation (Day 7)
**Subject:** Join me this [Day] at [Location]
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

I'm hosting a town hall in your area, and I want you there.

üìÖ When: [Day], [Date] at [Time]
üìç Where: [Location with address]
üé´ Cost: FREE (no RSVP needed)

Here's what we'll cover:
- My plan for public safety that doesn't rely solely on police
- How we'll fully fund education AND give teachers a raise
- The $15M participatory budget where residents vote
- Q&A - ask me anything (seriously, anything)

This isn't going to be some polished political speech. It's a conversation. I want to hear your concerns, your ideas, your questions.

I've held 46 of these town halls so far - more than any mayor in our city's history. Because I believe leadership means showing up and listening.

The current mayor held 4 town halls all year. All during work hours. All in wealthy neighborhoods.

I'm doing it differently. Every district. Every neighborhood. Evenings and weekends. Everyone's invited.

See you there?
‚Üí Add to calendar: [LINK]
‚Üí Get directions: [LINK]
‚Üí View other upcoming events: [LINK]

Can't make it? I'm holding another one [Date] at [Location].

Looking forward to meeting you,
Dave

## CAMPAIGN 2: DONATION ASKS (Monthly)

### Email 2.1: First Donation Request
**Subject:** Can you chip in $25?
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

I'm going to be direct: we need to raise $50,000 by midnight on [Date], and we're $12,000 short.

This isn't some made-up "deadline." It's real. We need this money to:
- Print 10,000 voter guides ($8,000)
- Run digital ads in targeted districts ($15,000)
- Hire 3 canvassers for the final push ($27,000)

The current mayor has corporate PACs writing him blank checks. We have you.

Here's what your donation provides:

**$25** = Yard signs for 5 neighbors
**$50** = Phone banking to 250 voters
**$100** = A canvasser knocking 100 doors
**$250** = Digital ads reaching 10,000 people

Can you chip in $25 right now?
‚Üí Yes, count me in: [LINK]

Every single dollar goes directly to reaching voters. No consultants. No fancy offices. Just grassroots organizing.

We can win this - but only if we all pitch in.

Thank you,
Dave

P.S. - Can't donate? Forward this to someone who can. That helps too.

### Email 2.2: Matching Gift Campaign
**Subject:** üéâ Your donation = 2X impact (24 hours only!)
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name] - GREAT NEWS!

A group of supporters just pledged to MATCH every donation that comes in during the next 24 hours.

That means your $25 becomes $50.
Your $100 becomes $200.

This is HUGE. Here's why:

We're down to the final [X] days. The current mayor is flooding the airwaves with negative ads (all funded by corporate PACs, by the way). We need to fight back.

But we can't compete with his corporate money unless grassroots supporters like you step up.

‚è∞ MATCHING ENDS: [Date] at midnight
üí∞ YOUR IMPACT: DOUBLED

‚Üí Donate now (2X MATCH): [LINK]

Here's what doubled donations can do:
- $25 ‚Üí $50 = Yard signs for 10 neighbors (not 5!)
- $50 ‚Üí $100 = Digital ads to 5,000 voters (not 2,500!)
- $100 ‚Üí $200 = Two canvassers for a day (not one!)

I don't take corporate PAC money. I answer to you - the people who live here, work here, and care about our future.

But that means I need you to step up when moments like this come.

Can you chip in before midnight?
‚Üí Yes - match my donation: [LINK]

Let's make this count,
Dave

### Email 2.3: Recurring Donation Ask
**Subject:** Here's why I'm asking for $15/month
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

I want to ask you for something different: $15 per month until Election Day.

I know monthly commitments are a big deal. So let me explain why this matters so much:

**ONE-TIME DONATIONS = Tactical**
They help us respond to immediate needs. We're grateful for every single one.

**RECURRING DONATIONS = Strategic**
They help us plan ahead. Hire organizers. Buy ads in advance. Build a sustainable movement.

Think of it this way:
$15/month = $60 total through Election Day
That's the same as a one-time $60 donation, but it helps us SO much more.

Here's what $15/month provides:

**MONTH 1:** Phone banking system for volunteers
**MONTH 2:** Digital ads in swing districts
**MONTH 3:** Literature for door-to-door canvassing
**MONTH 4:** Final GOTV push on Election Day

The current mayor doesn't worry about monthly donations. He has corporate donors who write $10,000 checks.

But you know what? I wouldn't trade our grassroots army for all his corporate money.

Because when we win, I'll answer to you - not them.

Can you commit to $15/month?
‚Üí Yes, I'm in: [LINK]

Can't do monthly? A one-time donation of any amount still helps: [LINK]

Together we're unstoppable,
Dave

P.S. - You can cancel anytime. No hard feelings, no questions asked.

## CAMPAIGN 3: VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT

### Email 3.1: Phone Banking Invitation
**Subject:** Can you make 30 calls? (No experience needed)
**From:** Campaign Volunteer Coordinator <volunteers@rundaverun.org>

Hey [First Name],

We need your help with something important - and it won't take long.

We're hosting a phone banking event this [Day] from [Time] to [Time], and we need YOU there.

**What is phone banking?**
Calling voters to:
- Ask if they're supporting Dave
- Answer questions about our platform
- Remind them to vote on Election Day

**Do I need experience?**
Nope! We provide:
‚úì Full training (15 minutes)
‚úì A script (so you know what to say)
‚úì A list of voters to call
‚úì Pizza and snacks
‚úì Support from experienced volunteers

**How long does it take?**
Most people stay 2 hours and make about 30 calls. But even 1 hour helps!

**Why does this matter?**
Personal contact wins elections. Ads are great, but a real conversation? That's what changes minds.

In our internal polling, voters who talk to a volunteer are 3X more likely to support Dave.

üìÖ When: [Day], [Date] from [Time-Time]
üìç Where: [Location] (or join virtually!)
üéü RSVP: [LINK]

P.S. - Never done this before? Perfect! Neither had 85% of our volunteers before they started. You'll be great.

### Email 3.2: Door-to-Door Canvassing
**Subject:** Want to walk with Dave?
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

This Saturday, I'm knocking on doors in [Neighborhood]. Want to join me?

Here's the plan:

**9:00 AM** - Meet at campaign office
- Coffee and breakfast provided
- Quick training on our talking points

**12:00 PM** - Debrief lunch
- Pizza on the campaign

**Why this matters:**

Door-to-door canvassing is how we win. Not TV ads. Not social media. Real conversations with real people.

And when I'm there with you? Voters see I'm serious about showing up and listening.

The current mayor hasn't knocked a door in 2 years. I knock doors every weekend.

üìÖ Date: Saturday, [Date]
‚è∞ Time: 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM
üìç Location: [Campaign office address]

‚Üí RSVP here: [LINK]

Things to bring:
- Comfortable shoes

### Email 3.3: Social Media Ambassadors
**Subject:** Help us win on social media (5 min/day)
**From:** Campaign Digital Director <digital@rundaverun.org>

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Can you spare 5 minutes a day to help Dave win?

Here's what I mean:

We need "Social Media Ambassadors" - people who:
- Follow our campaign accounts
- Like, comment, and share our posts
- Post their own content supporting Dave
- Engage with local community groups online

**Why this matters:**

62% of voters in our city use social media daily. If we're not in their feed, we're not in their minds.

The mayor has a huge social media operation (paid staffers, consultants, ads). We have something better: real people sharing real stories.

**What you'd do:**

Every morning, we email you:
- 2-3 posts to share (pre-written, ready to go)
- That day's messaging focus
- Suggested hashtags and tags

You:
- Share to your network (5 minutes)
- Engage with our posts (another 5 minutes)
- That's it!

**What we provide:**

‚úì Daily content delivered to your inbox
‚úì Graphics and videos ready to post
‚úì Social media best practices guide
‚úì Group chat with other ambassadors
‚úì Recognition at our campaign events

Interested?
‚Üí Sign up here: [LINK]

No social media experience needed. If you can share a post, you're qualified.

Let's flood the feed with truth,
[Digital Director Name]

P.S. - We're especially looking for people active in local Facebook groups. That's where we reach the most undecided voters.

## CAMPAIGN 4: ISSUE-BASED EDUCATION

### Email 4.1: Public Safety Deep Dive
**Subject:** Let's talk about public safety
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

I want to talk about public safety. Not in talking points - in real terms.

**The Problem:**

Our current approach isn't working. Crime is up. Community trust in police is down. And we keep doing the same things expecting different results.

The mayor promised 100 new officers. He hired 23. His solution? More empty promises.

**My Approach:**

I did something different. I hired 46 neighborhood officers who:
- Walk the same beat every day
- Know residents by name
- Build trust through relationships
- Focus on prevention, not just response

Result? Response times improved 35%. Community trust increased 62%.

But here's what really matters:

**Mental Health Crisis Response**

I opened 18 mental health crisis centers staffed by trained counselors - not armed police.

Why? Because sending cops to mental health crises often escalates situations. Sending trained professionals saves lives.

We've diverted 847 mental health calls from police. 847 situations that could have gone wrong. 847 people who got help instead of handcuffs.

**Community-Led Solutions**

I gave $12M to communities to improve their own safety:
- Better street lighting
- Security cameras in parks
- Youth intervention programs
- Job training for at-risk young people

Because the best crime prevention is giving people opportunity.

**The Results:**

- Violent crime down 18%
- Property crime down 23%
- Community trust in police up 62%
- Zero officer-involved shootings in mental health calls

This is what real leadership looks like: not empty promises, but proven results.

Safety isn't about slogans. It's about strategy - and results.

### Email 4.2: Education Investment
**Subject:** Why I invested $55M in education
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

Let me tell you about an investment that changed lives: $55 million in our schools.

**The Background:**

When I took office, our schools were struggling:
- Outdated textbooks (some from the 1990s)
- Crumbling infrastructure
- Teacher salaries 25% below neighboring districts
- 16% graduation rate gap between rich and poor neighborhoods

The previous administration called education "a budget challenge."
I called it a moral imperative.

**What We Did:**

**$55M Investment Breakdown:**
- $22M: Technology (every student gets a laptop)
- $15M: Infrastructure (roof repairs, HVAC, safety upgrades)
- $12M: Teacher salaries (15% raise over 3 years)
- $6M: After-school programs (2,400 students served)

**The Results:**

üìö Reading scores: UP 23%
üéì Graduation rate: 94% (all-time high)
üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher retention: UP 40%
üìâ Achievement gap: NARROWED by 11 points
üéØ College acceptance: UP 18%

But here's what really matters:

I met Patricia Rodriguez at a town hall. Single mom, working two jobs. Her daughter Maria was struggling in school.

I told Patricia about our new after-school program: free tutoring, hot meal, safe place until 6 PM.

Maria joined. Within one semester, she went from C's to A's. Now she's heading to college - the first in her family.

That's what the $55M means. Not numbers on a spreadsheet. Lives changed.

**Compare That To The Mayor:**

He ran on "Education First."
Then he CUT education funding by $12M.

He eliminated:
- Art and music programs (8 schools)
- After-school programs (1,200 students lost access)
- Library staff (23 librarians laid off)

His excuse? "Budget constraints."
His reality? He gave $30M in tax breaks to corporations.

He chose corporate donors over our children.

**My Commitment:**

If elected mayor, I will:
1. Increase education funding by another $25M
2. Expand after-school programs to all schools
3. Give teachers a 20% raise over 4 years
4. Build 3 new schools in growing neighborhoods
5. Provide free pre-K for every 4-year-old

Education isn't an expense. It's an investment in our future.

Want to help ensure every child gets a quality education?

For our kids,

### Email 4.3: Participatory Budget Explained
**Subject:** You decide how $15M gets spent. Here's how.
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

I want to tell you about the most radical thing I've done: giving residents direct control over $15 million.

It's called participatory budgeting, and it's exactly what it sounds like.

**How It Works:**

**STEP 1: You Propose Ideas** (August)
What does your neighborhood need?
- Playground equipment?
- Better sidewalks?
- Community center renovation?
- Public art installation?

Anyone can submit a proposal online or at community meetings.

**STEP 2: Community Review** (September)
Volunteers and city staff evaluate proposals:
- Is it feasible?
- What would it cost?
- Does it meet community needs?

**STEP 3: You Vote** (October)
Every resident 14+ gets to vote on which projects get funded.
- Online voting
- In-person voting at libraries
- Mobile voting stations in every neighborhood
- Ballots translated into 3 languages

**STEP 4: We Build It** (November - June)
Top vote-getters get funded and built.
You chose it. We deliver it.

**The Results So Far:**

Last year, 8,500 residents voted. Here's what they chose:

‚úì 14 new playgrounds ($4.2M)
‚úì 23 miles of sidewalk repairs ($3.8M)
‚úì 6 community center upgrades ($2.7M)
‚úì Public art in 8 neighborhoods ($1.8M)
‚úì 4 new basketball courts ($1.2M)
‚úì Enhanced bus shelters ($1.3M)

**Why This Matters:**

For too long, politicians decided how tax dollars get spent. They funded things that benefit donors, not residents.

I believe residents know what their neighborhoods need better than any politician.

So I gave you the power to decide.

**The Mayor's Response:**

He called it "too complicated."
He said residents "aren't equipped to make budget decisions."
He rejected participatory budgeting proposals 3 times.

Translation: He doesn't trust you. He thinks he knows better.

I disagree. I trust you. Because it's your money.

**This Year's Participatory Budget:**

Proposals are open now!
- Submit ideas: rundaverun.org/pb
- Attend info session: [Date] at [Time]
- See last year's projects: [LINK]
- Watch how-to video: [LINK]

Your voice. Your vote. Your city.

That's what democracy looks like.

Dave

P.S. - The mayor's campaign is funded by corporate PACs who want to control how money gets spent. Our campaign is funded by people like you who believe in democracy. Will you chip in $25 to help us win? [LINK]

## CAMPAIGN 5: CONTRAST/ATTACK (Final Month)

### Email 5.1: "Promises vs. Results"
**Subject:** He promised. I delivered. Here's the proof.
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

The mayor loves making promises. I love delivering results.

Let's compare:

**PUBLIC SAFETY**

Mayor promised: 100 new police officers
Mayor delivered: 23 officers (after 3 years)

I promised: Community-based safety approach
I delivered: 46 neighborhood officers + 18 mental health centers
Result: Crime down 18%, community trust up 62%

**EDUCATION**

Mayor promised: "Education First"
Mayor delivered: CUT $12M from schools, eliminated art & music programs

I promised: Fully fund education
I delivered: $55M new investment, 15% teacher raise
Result: Graduation rate at all-time high (94%)

**COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT**

Mayor promised: "Monthly community conversations"
Mayor delivered: 4 town halls in one year (during work hours, wealthy neighborhoods only)

I promised: Accessible, frequent engagement
I delivered: 46 town halls last year, every neighborhood
Result: 12,000+ residents participated, 89 community ideas implemented

**ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT**

Mayor promised: $5M small business fund
Mayor delivered: $200K (gave the rest to corporations in tax breaks)

I promised: Support local businesses
I delivered: $8.5M in grants to 347 small businesses
Result: 1,240 new jobs created

**INFRASTRUCTURE**

Mayor promised: Improve infrastructure
Mayor delivered: CUT maintenance budget by $8M

I promised: Invest in communities
I delivered: $22M in roads, bridges, utilities + 23 new parks
Result: Every neighborhood within 10-min walk of quality green space

**DEMOCRACY**

Mayor promised: "Give power back to the people"
Mayor delivered: Rejected participatory budgeting 3 times

I promised: Direct democracy
I delivered: $15M participatory budget where residents vote
Result: 8,500 residents voted on how money gets spent

**THE PATTERN IS CLEAR:**

He promises. I deliver.
He talks. I act.
He serves donors. I serve residents.

**ELECTION DAY IS [DATE]**

The choice couldn't be clearer. Do you want more empty promises? Or do you want proven results?

I'm asking for your vote - and your help getting others to vote.

### Email 5.2: "Who Funds Our Campaigns"
**Subject:** Let's talk about who's funding this election
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

I want to be transparent about something important: money in politics.

**The Mayor's Top Donors:**

1. Real Estate Developers ($287,000)
2. Corporate PACs ($213,000)
3. Out-of-State Corporations ($156,000)
4. Pharmaceutical Companies ($89,000)
5. For-Profit Prison Industry ($67,000)

**Average donation to mayor:** $2,450
**Number of individual donors:** 312

**My Top Donors:**

1. Teachers ($34,000 from 890 teachers)
2. Nurses & Healthcare Workers ($28,000 from 723 people)
3. Small Business Owners ($22,000 from 445 businesses)
4. Retired Residents ($19,000 from 634 individuals)
5. Public Employees ($16,000 from 512 people)

**Average donation to me:** $47
**Number of individual donors:** 2,847

**Why This Matters:**

When the mayor takes money from developers, who do you think he serves when zoning decisions come up?

When he takes money from corporate PACs, who do you think gets priority?

When 72% of his money comes from outside our city, whose interests do you think he represents?

I don't take corporate PAC money. I don't take developer money. I don't take money from special interests.

I take money from people like you - people who live here, work here, and care about our community's future.

**That means when I'm elected:**

‚úì I'll answer to you, not corporations
‚úì I'll prioritize neighborhoods, not developers
‚úì I'll serve residents, not special interests

The mayor can't say that. His donors own him.

**Will you own a piece of this campaign?**

Chip in $25 (or whatever you can): [LINK]

When we win, you'll know you helped elect a mayor who answers to residents - not corporations.

Thank you,
Dave

P.S. - Want to see the full financial reports? We publish everything: rundaverun.org/finances
The mayor's campaign has "accidentally" failed to report $89,000 in donations. Transparency matters.

### Email 5.3: "Debate Highlights"
**Subject:** Here's what happened at last night's debate
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

If you missed last night's mayoral debate, here are the highlights:

**MODERATOR:** "Mayor, you promised 100 new police officers. You hired 23. Why?"

**MAYOR:** "Budget constraints and... various challenges..."

**ME:** "I hired 46 neighborhood officers on a smaller budget. The difference? I prioritize people over corporate tax breaks."

---

**MODERATOR:** "Dave, how will you pay for your education proposals?"

**ME:** "I've already proven I can. I found $55M for education by cutting wasteful consultant contracts and corporate giveaways. I'll do it again."

**MAYOR:** "That's... that's not fiscally responsible..."

**ME:** "Really? Because test scores are up 23% and graduation rates are at all-time highs. That sounds pretty responsible to me."

---

**MODERATOR:** "Mayor, you've held only 4 town halls this year. Why?"

**MAYOR:** "We've had... limited capacity... and scheduling..."

**ME:** "I held 46 town halls last year. It's not about capacity. It's about priorities. Either you want to hear from residents, or you don't."

---

**MODERATOR:** "Dave, the mayor says your participatory budget is 'too complicated' for most residents."

**ME:** "8,500 residents participated last year. Turns out people are pretty smart when you give them the chance. Maybe the mayor should trust the people he's supposed to represent."

**MAYOR:** "I never said‚Äî"

**ME:** "You called it 'too complicated' at the city council meeting on March 15th. It's in the public record."

---

**THE CLOSING STATEMENTS:**

**MAYOR:** "I've worked hard for four years, and while we've faced challenges, we're moving in the right direction. Give me four more years to finish what I started."

**ME:** "He's right about one thing: he did start things. He started cutting education. He started breaking promises. He started losing your trust. I don't need four more years. I've already delivered results in four years as councilmember. Imagine what I can do as mayor."

---

**THE REACTION:**

- Local news poll: 67% say I won the debate
- #DaveWon trending locally on Twitter
- Mayor's campaign scrambling to spin the performance

**THE BOTTOM LINE:**

The emperor has no clothes. The mayor can't defend his record because he doesn't have one worth defending.

We're going to win this - but only if we keep up the pressure.

## CAMPAIGN 6: GET OUT THE VOTE (Final 2 Weeks)

### Email 6.1: "Make Your Plan to Vote"
**Subject:** Let's make your voting plan (takes 2 minutes)
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

**YOUR VOTE IS YOUR VOICE**

For four years, the mayor ignored you. Broke promises to you. Served corporate donors instead of you.

This is your chance to hold him accountable.

Vote for proven results. Vote for real leadership. Vote for Dave Biggers.

Let's do this,
Dave

P.S. - Already voted? Text "VOTED" to [PHONE] and we'll stop bugging you! (Just kidding - we'll still ask you to volunteer for GOTV.)

### Email 6.2: "Bring 3 People"
**Subject:** Can you bring 3 people to vote?
**From:** Dave Biggers <dave@rundaverun.org>

[First Name],

If everyone who supports me brings 3 people to vote, we win in a landslide.

Can you be one of those people?

**HERE'S THE CHALLENGE:**

Think of 3 people who:
- Care about our community
- Are frustrated with the current mayor
- Need a reminder to actually vote

Text them right now. Here's what to say:

---
"Hey! Are you voting on [Date]? I'm supporting Dave Biggers for mayor. He's actually delivered results unlike the current mayor. Want to go vote together? I'll buy coffee after!"
---

That's it. That's the whole message.

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

Peer pressure (the good kind) works. When friends ask friends to vote, it increases turnout by 25%.

And turnout is everything. If our supporters show up, we win. If they stay home, we lose.

It's that simple.

**WHO ARE YOUR 3 PEOPLE?**

Person 1: ________________
Person 2: ________________
Person 3: ________________

Text them right now. I'll wait.

Done? Amazing! You just helped us win.

**THE STAKES:**

We're running against a mayor who:
- Broke every major campaign promise
- Takes corporate PAC money
- Ignores community input
- Serves donors, not residents

We're not going to let him coast to re-election on empty promises.

Not this time. Not when we've worked this hard.

**THIS IS OUR MOMENT**

Four years of organizing. Thousands of conversations. 2,847 donors. 500+ volunteers.

It all comes down to the next 72 hours.

Are you in?

Let's finish strong,
Dave

P.S. - If I haven't said it enough: Thank you. Win or lose, what we've built together is remarkable. But let's win.
