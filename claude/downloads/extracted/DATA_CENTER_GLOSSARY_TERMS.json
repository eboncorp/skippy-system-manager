    "term": "Data Center",
    "definition": "A large facility that houses computer servers and networking equipment used to store, process, and distribute digital information for businesses and organizations. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta operate massive data centers that power cloud services, websites, and apps. Louisville is being considered for data center development due to our central location, low natural disaster risk, and competitive utility rates.",

    "louisvilleExample": "A major tech company is evaluating Louisville for a 500,000+ square foot data center that could create 50-100 permanent jobs and generate millions in annual tax revenue.",
    "voterImpact": "Data centers bring high-tech jobs and substantial tax revenue, but require significant electricity and water resources that affect utility costs and environmental planning.",
    "keyFacts": [
      "Average data center uses 10-50 megawatts of power (enough for 30,000-150,000 homes)",
      "Typical construction cost: $200 million - $1 billion",
      "Creates 50-150 permanent jobs plus 500-1,000 construction jobs",
      "Often receive 10-15 year tax abatements from local governments"

    "term": "Hyperscale Data Center",
    "definition": "An extremely large data center (typically 500,000+ square feet) operated by major tech companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. These facilities can cost over $1 billion to build and consume as much electricity as a small city. Hyperscale centers often seek locations with cheap electricity, reliable power grids, and fiber optic connectivity—which makes Louisville attractive.",

    "aliases": ["Hyperscaler", "Mega Data Center", "Cloud Data Center"],
    "louisvilleExample": "The proposed Louisville data center would likely be hyperscale, requiring its own electrical substation and consuming 30-50 megawatts continuously.",
    "voterImpact": "Hyperscale facilities bring major economic investment but put substantial strain on electrical infrastructure and water resources.",
    "keyFacts": [
      "Typically 500,000 - 2 million square feet",
      "Consume 30-100+ megawatts of power continuously",
      "Use 3-5 million gallons of water daily for cooling",
      "Represent $500 million - $1.5 billion investment per facility"

    "term": "Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)",
    "definition": "A metric measuring how efficiently a data center uses electricity, calculated by dividing total facility energy use by energy used for computing equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means half the power goes to computing and half to cooling/overhead. Modern efficient data centers achieve PUE around 1.2-1.5. Louisville's moderate climate (avoiding extreme heat) makes efficient cooling easier compared to Southern states.",

    "aliases": ["PUE Rating", "Energy Efficiency Ratio"],
    "louisvilleExample": "A data center proposal in Louisville should target PUE below 1.4 to minimize strain on LG&E's electrical grid and reduce environmental impact.",
    "voterImpact": "Lower PUE means less electricity waste, reducing environmental impact and utility infrastructure burden on the city.",
    "technicalNote": "PUE of 1.0 is theoretically perfect (impossible), 1.2-1.5 is excellent, 1.5-2.0 is typical, above 2.0 is inefficient"

  {
    "term": "Data Center Tax Abatement",
    "definition": "Property tax reductions or exemptions offered by local governments to attract data center development, typically lasting 10-15 years. These incentives are controversial—supporters argue data centers create jobs and eventual tax revenue, while critics note the facilities use enormous public resources (electricity, water, infrastructure) while often employing fewer workers than expected. Louisville Metro Council must approve any abatement over $200,000.",
