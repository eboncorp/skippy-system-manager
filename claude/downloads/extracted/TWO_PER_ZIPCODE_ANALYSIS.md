# ANALYSIS: Two Mini Substations Per ZIP Code
**Dave Biggers for Mayor Campaign**  
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** Budget Scenario Analysis

---

## üìä THE CALCULATION

**If you deploy TWO mini substations per residential ZIP code:**

- **36 residential ZIP codes √ó 2 substations = 72 total substations**
- **Cost per substation: $200,000/year**
- **Officers per substation: 6**

### **TOTAL ANNUAL COST: $14,400,000**
### **TOTAL OFFICERS NEEDED: 432**

---

## üí∞ BUDGET COMPARISON

### Your Current Plans:

**Original Plan (46 substations):**
- Annual cost: $9,200,000
- Officers: 276

**Revised Plan (36 substations - one per ZIP):**
- Annual cost: $7,200,000
- Officers: 216

### New Proposal (72 substations - TWO per ZIP):

**Annual cost: $14,400,000**
- **$5.2M MORE than 46-station plan** (+56.5%)
- **$7.2M MORE than 36-station plan** (+100% - literally double)

**Officers needed: 432**
- **41.6% of current force**
- **156 more than 46-station plan**
- **216 more than 36-station plan**

---

## üìÖ 4-YEAR DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

### Option A: Even Distribution (18 per year)

- **Year 1:** 18 substations ($3.6M annual cost)
- **Year 2:** 18 more (36 total, $7.2M annual)
- **Year 3:** 18 more (54 total, $10.8M annual)
- **Year 4:** 18 more (72 total, $14.4M annual)

**4-year cumulative cost:** $36,000,000

---

### Option B: Priority Deployment (High-crime first)

- **Year 1:** 24 substations in 12 high-crime ZIPs ($4.8M annual)
- **Year 2:** 24 more (48 total, $9.6M annual)
- **Year 3:** 16 more (64 total, $12.8M annual)
- **Year 4:** 8 more (72 total, $14.4M annual)

**4-year cumulative cost:** $41,600,000

---

## üíµ WHERE DOES THE EXTRA $5.2M COME FROM?

You need an additional **$5.2M annually** compared to your 46-station plan.

### Option 1: Increase Patrol & Response Budget

- Current: $129.2M
- New: $134.4M
- Increase needed: $5.2M (4% increase)

### Option 2: Cut Other Programs

**Wellness Centers:** Reduce from 18 to 15
- Saves: $4.5M annually
- Need to find: $700K more elsewhere

**Youth Programs:** Reduce slightly
- Current: $35M
- Could reduce: $2-3M
- Savings: Enough to cover gap

**Participatory Budgeting:** Scale back Year 1
- Current Year 1: $6M district level
- Could delay or reduce
- Savings: Variable

### Option 3: Cut Other LMPD Spending

**Technology:** Reduce $15M ‚Üí $12M (saves $3M)
**Investigations:** Reduce $35.2M ‚Üí $33M (saves $2.2M)
**Total savings:** $5.2M ‚úì

## ‚úÖ BENEFITS OF TWO PER ZIP CODE

### 1. **Maximum Coverage**
- Smaller patrol radius per station
- Faster response times within each ZIP
- More geographic penetration
- No resident more than 5-7 minutes from a station

### 2. **Redundancy & Backup**
- If one station overwhelmed, other can help
- Better coverage during shift changes
- Competition/comparison between stations
- One closes for maintenance, other still operational

### 3. **Stronger Political Messaging**
- "Not just one station - TWO in your ZIP code"
- Shows ultra-serious commitment to public safety
- Hard for Greenberg to attack as insufficient
- "We're going above and beyond"

### 4. **Better Crime Prevention**
- More officers visible in each neighborhood
- Higher density of police presence
- Harder for crime to hide
- More community touchpoints

---

## ‚ùå DRAWBACKS OF TWO PER ZIP CODE

### 1. **Much Higher Cost**
- Additional $5.2M annually vs 46-station plan
- Additional $7.2M annually vs 36-station plan
- That's money that could fund:
  - 3 additional wellness centers
  - Major expansion of youth programs
  - Significant infrastructure improvements

### 2. **Officer Resource Drain**
- 432 officers = 41.6% of current force
- That's a LOT of officers in substations
- May reduce capacity for investigations, specialized units
- Requires sustained staffing levels

### 3. **Diminishing Returns**
- One well-placed station per ZIP may be enough
- Second station might not add proportional value
- Could geographic coverage be achieved with 36?
- Law of diminishing returns applies

### 4. **Operational Complexity**
- 72 locations to manage (vs 36)
- Double the real estate acquisition
- Double the logistics and coordination
- More complex command structure
- Higher administrative overhead

### 5. **Longer Deployment Timeline**
- 72 stations take longer to deploy than 36
- More rental negotiations, more setup
- Could delay achieving full coverage
- Implementation challenges multiply

## üéØ SCENARIO COMPARISON

### Scenario 1: One Per ZIP (36 Total) - RECOMMENDED

**Cost:** $7,200,000/year  
**Officers:** 216 (20.8% of force)  
**Coverage:** Comprehensive - every residential neighborhood  
**Deployment:** 4 years (10-10-10-6 distribution)

**PROS:**
‚úÖ Affordable and achievable  
‚úÖ Still comprehensive coverage  
‚úÖ Manageable officer allocation  
‚úÖ Defensible approach  
‚úÖ Proven in other cities

**CONS:**
‚ö†Ô∏è Larger patrol areas per station  
‚ö†Ô∏è Potentially slower response in large ZIPs  

**MESSAGE:** "One mini substation in every residential neighborhood"

---

### Scenario 2: Two Per ZIP (72 Total) - NOT RECOMMENDED

**Cost:** $14,400,000/year  
**Officers:** 432 (41.6% of force)  
**Coverage:** Maximum - two per residential neighborhood  
**Deployment:** 4 years (18-18-18-18 distribution)

**PROS:**

‚ùå Huge officer commitment (41.6% of force)  
‚ùå Operational complexity (72 locations)  
‚ùå Diminishing returns on 2nd station per ZIP  
‚ùå Takes resources from other critical programs

**MESSAGE:** "TWO mini substations in every neighborhood"

---

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Model (48 Total) - COMPROMISE OPTION

**Structure:**
- 12 high-crime ZIPs get 2 stations each = 24 substations
- 24 lower-crime ZIPs get 1 station each = 24 substations
- **Total: 48 substations**

**Cost:** $9,600,000/year  
**Officers:** 288 (27.7% of force)  
**Coverage:** Strategic - extra focus on high-crime areas  
**Deployment:** 4 years (12-12-12-12 distribution)

**PROS:**
‚úÖ Better than one-per-ZIP in high-crime areas  
‚úÖ Still affordable (only $2.4M more than 36-station)  
‚úÖ Strategic resource deployment  
‚úÖ Good political message

**CONS:**
‚ö†Ô∏è More expensive than one-per-ZIP  
‚ö†Ô∏è Some neighborhoods may feel left out  
‚ö†Ô∏è Need to justify which get 2 vs 1

**MESSAGE:** "Extra police support where crime is highest"

---

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

### ‚ùå **DO NOT** deploy two substations per ZIP code

**Why not:**

1. **The cost isn't worth it** - $7.2M extra annually
2. **Diminishing returns** - Second station per ZIP adds limited value
3. **Better uses for the money** - Wellness centers, youth programs
4. **Operational complexity** - Managing 72 locations vs 36
5. **Officer drain** - 432 officers is too much (41.6% of force)

---

### ‚úÖ **INSTEAD:** Choose one of these options

## **OPTION A: Stick with 36 Substations** (My Top Recommendation)

**Why this is best:**

‚úÖ **Comprehensive coverage** - Every residential neighborhood covered  
‚úÖ **Affordable** - $7.2M annually  
‚úÖ **Achievable** - 216 officers (manageable)  
‚úÖ **Proven model** - Works in other cities  
‚úÖ **Honest messaging** - "One in every residential neighborhood"  
‚úÖ **Leaves budget** for wellness centers, youth programs

**This gives you everything you need without overextending.**

---

## **OPTION B: Hybrid Model - 48 Substations** (Compromise)

If you want MORE than 36 but less than 72:

**Structure:**
- 2 substations in 12 highest-crime ZIPs
- 1 substation in remaining 24 ZIPs
- Total: 48 substations

**Cost:** $9.6M annually (only $2.4M more than 36-station)  
**Officers:** 288 (still manageable)  
**Message:** "Extra support where needed most"

**This is a reasonable middle ground** if you want to show extra commitment to high-crime areas without doubling the entire program.

---

## **OPTION C: Better Equipped 36 Substations**

Instead of building 72 stations, build 36 BETTER stations:

**Use the $7.2M you'd save to:**
- 8-10 officers per station (instead of 6)
- Better equipment and technology
- Community program budgets per station
- Enhanced training for all substation officers
- Backup vehicles and resources

**Message:** "Serious, professional police presence in every neighborhood"

---

## üìã BUDGET IMPACT SUMMARY

| Scenario | Substations | Annual Cost | Officers | vs 36-Station |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Current (46)** | 46 | $9.2M | 276 | +$2M |
| **One per ZIP (36)** | 36 | $7.2M | 216 | Baseline |
| **Hybrid (48)** | 48 | $9.6M | 288 | +$2.4M |
| **Two per ZIP (72)** | 72 | $14.4M | 432 | +$7.2M |

---

## üé¨ BOTTOM LINE

**Two substations per ZIP code = 72 total stations**

### The Math:
- **Cost:** $14.4M annually (double the 36-station plan)
- **Officers:** 432 (41.6% of current force)
- **Extra vs one-per-ZIP:** $7.2M annually

### The Verdict:
**Not worth it.** Diminishing returns on the second station per ZIP.

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD

**Recommended approach: 36 substations (one per residential ZIP)**

Use the $7.2M you'd save (vs 72 stations) to:
- Fund wellness centers fully (18 centers)
- Expand youth programs
- Better equipment for the 36 stations you do build
- Keep overall budget lower

**One well-placed substation per residential ZIP code is:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive coverage
- ‚úÖ Affordable ($7.2M vs $14.4M)
- ‚úÖ Achievable (216 vs 432 officers)
- ‚úÖ Effective (proven model)
- ‚úÖ Defensible messaging

## üó£Ô∏è MESSAGING

### If you go with 36 (Recommended):

**Short Version:**
"36 mini substations - one in every residential neighborhood where families live."

**Long Version:**
"We're placing a mini substation in each of Louisville's 36 residential neighborhoods. Every community where families live gets dedicated, 24/7 police presence. We're not wasting money on P.O. Box facilities - we're focusing resources where people actually live."

**When asked "Why not more?":**
"One well-placed substation per neighborhood, properly staffed with 6 officers for 24/7 coverage, is proven effective. We'd rather do 36 right than do 72 half-heartedly. The $7.2M we save goes to wellness centers and youth programs to address the root causes of crime."

---

### If you go with 72 (Not Recommended):

**Short Version:**
"72 mini substations - TWO in every residential neighborhood."

**When asked "How do you pay for it?":**
"We're making this our absolute top priority for public safety. [Then explain which programs you're cutting or which taxes you're raising - this is the hard part]"

**The attack you'll face:**
"Dave's spending $14.4M on substations while cutting wellness centers. He's all enforcement, no prevention. That's not smart - it's just more of the same failed approach."

---

## üö® FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Deploy 36 substations (one per residential ZIP), not 72.**

The second substation per ZIP doesn't add enough value to justify doubling the cost and officer commitment.

**Better strategy:**
- 36 well-staffed, well-equipped substations
- Use saved $7.2M for complementary programs
- Wellness centers (prevention)
- Youth programs (intervention)
- Community services (support)

**This is the balanced, comprehensive, affordable approach that will actually work.**

---

**Prepared by:** Campaign Analysis Team  
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Recommendation:** Stick with 36 substations (one per ZIP)

---

**You can have maximum coverage (72) or maximum effectiveness + other programs (36). You can't have both. Choose effectiveness.**
