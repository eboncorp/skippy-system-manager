## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION

### 1. Budget Number Clarification ‚ö†Ô∏è **URGENT**

**Issue:** Inconsistent budget figures across documents

**Documents Affected:**
- Campaign materials reference $898.8M (old)
- Website shows $1.2B (Budget 3.0)
- Internal docs mention $1.025B (Budget 3.1)

**Decision Required:**
Which is the official budget number to use everywhere?

**Impact:** HIGH
- Affects campaign messaging
- Media will ask about discrepancies
- Opponents may exploit inconsistencies

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (once number confirmed)

**Recommendation:** 
Establish official number immediately, then update all documents to match.

---

### 2. Website Final Configuration ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Issue:** 3 placeholder URLs + hero image need updating

**Time Required:** 15 minutes total

**Tasks:**
1. Update donation button URL
2. Connect email form to Mailchimp/service
3. Update social media links
4. Upload and set hero background image
5. Activate Contact Form 7

**Impact:** MEDIUM
- Website is functional but not optimized
- Missing call-to-action functionality
- Professional appearance incomplete without hero image

**Recommendation:**
Complete before heavy promotion or media coverage.

---

### 3. Glossary Integration Timeline ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Issue:** 5 weeks of work remaining (Phases 2-6)

**Current Status:** Phase 1 complete (1 of 6)

**Decision Required:**
- Continue with full 6-week implementation?
- Pause and focus on other priorities?
- Accelerate timeline?

**Impact:** MEDIUM
- Glossary is powerful differentiator
- Not critical for immediate campaign launch
- Adds substantial credibility and voter education value

**Recommendation:**
Continue implementation but adjust timeline based on campaign priorities. Can complete Phases 2-4 (document enhancement) quickly, then schedule WordPress integration (Phase 5) when convenient.
