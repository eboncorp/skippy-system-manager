### TOP 10 TERMS - QUICK REFERENCE

**1. PARTICIPATORY BUDGETING**
**What it is:** YOU vote directly on how $25M is spent  
**In practice:** Each district gets $1M that residents vote on  
**Why it matters:** Real democracy, not just voting for representatives  
**Used in:** 11,500 cities worldwide including NYC, Paris, Chicago

**If asked more:** "It's like a neighborhood vote on projects. You submit ideas, the city checks if they're feasible, then everyone votes online or at community meetings. Winning projects get funded. It's democracy in action."

---

**2. MINI SUBSTATIONS (46 total)**
**What they are:** Small police stations IN neighborhoods, not downtown  
**Staffing:** 6-8 officers per station, walking beats not driving  
**Why it matters:** Officers know residents, prevent crime vs. react  
**Evidence:** 25-35% crime reduction in 50+ U.S. cities

**If asked more:** "Think of it like a neighborhood police outpost. Officers are there every day, know the community, build relationships. When you see the same officers regularly, you trust them more and crime goes down."

---

**3. COMMUNITY WELLNESS CENTERS (18 total)**
**What they are:** Healthcare + mental health + addiction treatment, all in one place  
**Services:** Doctor visits, counseling, help with insurance, all FREE or low-cost  
**Why it matters:** Prevents ER visits, treats root causes of crime  
**Evidence:** 35% ER reduction, $1.80 saved per $1 spent

**If asked more:** "It's a health center in your neighborhood. No insurance needed. Mental health counselor, addiction treatment, primary care doctor - all together. Prevents crises before they happen."

---

**4. BUDGET-NEUTRAL**
**What it means:** Same total budget as current ($1.2B), different priorities  
**No new taxes:** Uses existing money smarter  
**What changes:** Cut bureaucracy, invest in neighborhoods  
**Example:** Cut $24M admin waste → fund mini substations and wellness centers

**If asked more:** "Dave isn't asking for more taxpayer money. He's asking to spend the same $1.2B better. Cut waste, invest in what works. Same budget, better results."

---

**5. EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY**
**What it means:** Do what actually works, proven by data from other cities  
**Dave's approach:** Every program backed by evidence from 50+ cities  
**Not guessing:** Mini substations work (proven), youth programs work (proven)  
**Why it matters:** Your tax dollars go to programs that actually reduce crime

**If asked more:** "Dave doesn't guess. Every program in his plan is proven to work in other cities. We're not experimenting - we're copying success."

---

**6. FIRE PREVENTION CENTERS (15 total)**
**What they are:** Centers that prevent fires BEFORE they start  
**Services:** Free smoke detectors, home inspections, fire safety education  
**Why it matters:** 40% fewer fires, lives saved  
**Who benefits most:** Seniors, families with young children

**If asked more:** "Instead of just fighting fires, we prevent them. Free smoke detector installed in your home. Home safety inspection. Fire safety classes for kids. Stop fires before they start."

**7. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ($35M)**
**What they are:** After-school programs, summer jobs, mentoring  
**Hours:** 3-7pm (peak crime hours covered)  
**Scale:** 15,000 youth in after-school, 3,000 summer jobs  
**Evidence:** 35% violence reduction among participants

**If asked more:** "When kids are busy after school, they're not on streets during peak crime hours. They're learning, working, getting mentored. It works - 35% less violence among kids in the program."

---

**8. CLAWBACK PROVISIONS**
**What they are:** Companies must repay incentives if they don't deliver jobs  
**Current problem:** Companies get tax breaks, don't create promised jobs  
**Dave's fix:** Strong clawbacks = taxpayer protection  
**Example:** PowerHouse data center got 25-year tax break, weak job requirements

**If asked more:** "If a company promises 100 jobs for a tax break but only creates 50, they repay 50% of the tax break. Simple accountability. Taxpayers shouldn't absorb all the risk."

---

**9. COMMUNITY BENEFITS AGREEMENT**
**What it is:** Contract requiring developers to provide community benefits  
**Typical benefits:** Local hiring, living wages, affordable units, park space  
**Why it matters:** Development should benefit neighborhood, not just developer  
**Dave's requirement:** CBA for all projects receiving city incentives

**If asked more:** "When a developer gets a tax break from the city, the community should benefit too. Community Benefits Agreements guarantee local jobs, affordable housing, community space. Fair deal for everyone."

---

**10. "DEFUNDING THE POLICE" (What Dave is NOT doing)**
**What it is:** Political slogan to cut police budgets  
**Dave's actual plan:** Police budget stays SAME ($379.7M)  
**What changes:** Cut admin ($11.6M), add patrol (+$14.2M via mini substations)  
**Reality:** More cops in neighborhoods, less bureaucracy, same total budget

**If asked more:** "Dave is NOT defunding police. The police budget stays exactly the same. He's cutting bureaucracy and putting more officers in your neighborhood through mini substations. That's smart policing, not defunding."
