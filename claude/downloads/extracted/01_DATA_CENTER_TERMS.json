    "term": "Hyperscale Data Center",
    "definition": "An extremely large data center (typically 500,000+ square feet) operated by major tech companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. These facilities can cost over $1 billion to build and consume as much electricity as a small city. Hyperscale centers seek locations with cheap electricity, reliable power grids, and fiber optic connectivity—which makes Louisville attractive.",

  {
    "term": "Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)",
    "definition": "A metric measuring how efficiently a data center uses electricity, calculated by dividing total facility energy use by energy used for computing equipment. A PUE of 2.0 means half the power goes to computing and half to cooling. Modern efficient data centers achieve PUE around 1.2-1.5. Louisville's moderate climate makes efficient cooling easier compared to Southern states.",

  {
    "term": "Data Center Tax Abatement",
    "definition": "Property tax reductions or exemptions offered by local governments to attract data center development, typically lasting 10-15 years. These incentives are controversial—supporters argue data centers create jobs and eventual tax revenue, while critics note the facilities use enormous public resources (electricity, water, infrastructure) while often employing fewer workers than traditional manufacturers. Louisville Metro Council must approve any abatement.",

  {
    "term": "Cooling Infrastructure",
    "definition": "The systems data centers use to prevent servers from overheating, including chillers, cooling towers, and air conditioning that can use millions of gallons of water daily. Cooling typically accounts for 30-50% of a data center's total energy consumption. Some newer facilities use 'free cooling' with outside air when temperatures permit, making Louisville's climate advantageous 4-5 months per year.",

  {
    "term": "Water Consumption (Data Centers)",
    "definition": "The amount of water data centers use for cooling systems, typically 3-5 million gallons per day for a large facility—equivalent to 30,000-50,000 people's daily water use. This becomes a critical issue during droughts or in water-stressed regions. Louisville's location on the Ohio River provides abundant water, but treatment capacity and wastewater processing remain considerations.",

  {
    "term": "Electrical Substation",
    "definition": "A facility where voltage is transformed from high to low or vice versa, and where electrical connections are made. Large data centers require dedicated substations to handle 30-100 megawatts of continuous power demand. Building a new substation costs $5-15 million and typically requires Louisville Gas & Electric (LG&E) partnership, with costs often shared between the utility and data center operator.",

  {
    "term": "Fiber Optic Network",
    "definition": "High-speed internet infrastructure using light pulses through glass cables to transmit data at speeds up to 100 times faster than traditional copper cables. Data centers require multiple redundant fiber connections for reliability. Louisville benefits from being a fiber hub with multiple competing providers, reducing internet transit costs for data center operators.",

    "term": "Cloud Computing",
    "definition": "The delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, software) over the internet rather than from local devices. When you use Gmail, stream Netflix, or store photos in iCloud, you're using cloud computing powered by data centers. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are the three largest providers, collectively operating hundreds of data centers worldwide.",

    "term": "Colocation Facility",
    "definition": "A data center where multiple companies rent space to house their own servers and equipment, sharing the building's power, cooling, and security infrastructure. Unlike hyperscale centers owned by single tech giants, colocation facilities serve dozens or hundreds of smaller businesses. These facilities typically employ more local workers per square foot than hyperscale centers.",

    "definition": "A unit of electrical power equal to one million watts, used to measure data center electricity consumption. One megawatt can power approximately 750-1,000 average American homes. A typical hyperscale data center uses 30-50 MW continuously—equivalent to 30,000-50,000 homes. For context, all of Louisville Metro uses about 1,500-2,000 MW at peak demand.",
