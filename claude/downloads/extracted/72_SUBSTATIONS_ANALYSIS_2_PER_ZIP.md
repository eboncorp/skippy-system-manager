**Dave Biggers for Mayor Campaign**  
**Date:** October 28, 2025

---

## üìä WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING

**2 mini substations in each of the 36 residential ZIP codes = 72 total substations**

---

## üí∞ THE NUMBERS

### Annual Cost Comparison:

**36 substations (1 per ZIP):** $7,200,000/year  
**72 substations (2 per ZIP):** $14,400,000/year  
**Difference:** $7,200,000 MORE per year (100% increase)

### 4-Year Total Cost:

**36 substations:** $19,200,000  
**72 substations:** $36,000,000  
**Difference:** $16,800,000 MORE over 4 years

### Officer Requirements:

**36 substations:** 216 officers (20.8% of LMPD force)  
**72 substations:** 432 officers (41.6% of LMPD force)  
**Difference:** 216 additional officers needed

---

## ‚úÖ IS THIS FEASIBLE?

### BUDGET: Yes, it fits

**Current Patrol & Response Budget:** $129,200,000

**With 72 substations:**
- Substation cost: $14,400,000 (11.1% of patrol budget)
- Remaining for other patrol: $114,800,000
- ‚úÖ **It fits within the budget**

### STAFFING: Tight but possible

**LMPD Current Status:**
- Officers on duty: 1,038
- Authorized capacity: 1,328
- Current shortage: 290 officers

**With 72 substations:**
- Officers in substations: 432 (41.6% of force)
- Officers remaining: 606 for ALL other duties:
  - Investigations
  - Training
  - Administration
  - Special units
  - School resource officers
  - Everything else

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a LOT of your force in substations**

## üéØ THREE OPTIONS TO CONSIDER

### OPTION A: 36 SUBSTATIONS (Conservative)

**The Plan:**
- 1 mini substation per residential ZIP code
- 36 total substations
- Strategic placement in each neighborhood

**The Numbers:**
- Cost: $7,200,000/year
- Officers: 216 (20.8% of force)
- 4-year total: $19,200,000

**The Message:**
> "One mini substation in every residential neighborhood where families live"

**Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Proven model (Boston, LA, Chicago)
- ‚úÖ Very achievable
- ‚úÖ Leaves majority of force for other duties
- ‚úÖ Strong community presence
- ‚úÖ Defensible and credible

---

### OPTION B: 72 SUBSTATIONS (Aggressive)

**The Plan:**
- 2 mini substations per residential ZIP code
- 72 total substations
- Maximum neighborhood coverage

**The Numbers:**
- Cost: $14,400,000/year
- Officers: 432 (41.6% of force)
- 4-year total: $36,000,000

**The Message:**
> "TWO mini substations in every residential neighborhood - unprecedented community policing"

**Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Very bold commitment
- ‚úÖ Unmatched coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Costs double Option A
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses 41.6% of entire police force
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May strain department capacity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Opponent may ask: "Why do we need TWO everywhere?"

---

### OPTION C: 48-54 SUBSTATIONS (Strategic - RECOMMENDED)

**The Plan:**
- 1 substation in most ZIP codes (24 ZIPs)
- 2 substations in large/high-crime ZIP codes (12 ZIPs)
- 48 total substations (or adjust to 54 based on data)

**The Numbers:**
- Cost: $9,600,000-$10,800,000/year
- Officers: 288-324 (27.7-31.2% of force)
- 4-year total: $25,600,000-$28,800,000

**The Message:**
> "At least one mini substation in every residential neighborhood, with additional stations in larger, higher-need areas based on crime data and community input"

**Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive coverage
- ‚úÖ Strategic placement based on need
- ‚úÖ More affordable than uniform 72
- ‚úÖ More ambitious than basic 36
- ‚úÖ Flexible, data-driven approach
- ‚úÖ Defensible: "We put resources where they're needed most"

## üé§ MESSAGING COMPARISON

### If You Choose 36 Substations:

**Your Pitch:**
> "One mini substation in every residential neighborhood in Louisville. That's 36 neighborhoods where families live - comprehensive coverage with proven, effective community policing."

**Defense:**
- ‚úÖ Matches exactly with 36 residential ZIP codes
- ‚úÖ Proven model from other cities
- ‚úÖ Affordable and achievable
- ‚úÖ Professional staffing (6 officers each)

---

### If You Choose 72 Substations:

**Your Pitch:**
> "TWO mini substations in every residential neighborhood - 72 total. No neighborhood left behind. The most comprehensive community policing program in America."

**Defense:**
- ‚úÖ Shows extraordinary commitment
- ‚úÖ Unmatched coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must justify why TWO per ZIP
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Opponent attacks on cost/staffing

**Potential Attack:**
> "Dave wants to put 432 officers - 42% of the entire police department - in buildings. That's absurd. We're 290 officers short and he wants nearly half the force sitting in substations? Who's actually out there preventing crime?"

**Your Response Would Need To Be:**
> "These officers aren't 'sitting in substations' - they're walking the streets, engaging the community, preventing crime before it happens. Studies show neighborhood policing reduces crime 35%. It works."

---

### If You Choose 48-54 Substations (RECOMMENDED):

**Your Pitch:**
> "At least one mini substation in every residential neighborhood, with two in larger, high-crime areas. That's 48 stations strategically deployed based on data and community need. Smart, targeted community policing."

**Defense:**
- ‚úÖ Shows you're data-driven
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive but strategic
- ‚úÖ "More where needed most"
- ‚úÖ Flexible as crime patterns change
- ‚úÖ Affordable yet ambitious

**Against Attacks:**
> "We're using crime data and community input to deploy resources where they're needed most. Some neighborhoods get two stations because they're larger or have higher crime. That's smart government - not one-size-fits-all."

---

## ü§î KEY QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

### Can LMPD operationally handle 432 officers (41.6%) in substations?

**Considerations:**
- That leaves only 606 officers for:
  - Investigations (detectives, forensics)
  - Training and professional development
  - Administration and support
  - Special units (SWAT, K9, mounted, etc.)
  - School resource officers
  - Traffic enforcement
  - Command staff

**Reality check:** Most police departments keep 60-70% of officers in patrol/field duties, but 41.6% in JUST substations (not counting regular patrol) is very high.

---

### Do all ZIP codes actually need 2 substations?

**Consider:**
- Some residential ZIPs are small
- Some have low crime rates
- Some are primarily residential with little commercial activity
- Two substations 1 mile apart in a small ZIP = redundant?

**Strategic alternative:** Put 2 where needed (large/high-crime), 1 where sufficient.

---

### What's the political benefit of saying "2 per ZIP"?

**Pros:**
- Sounds more comprehensive
- "TWO in every neighborhood" = strong commitment
- Differentiation from competitors

**Cons:**
- Opponent asks: "Why do we need TWO?"
- Looks like overkill in small, safe neighborhoods
- Costs double with questionable return on investment

---

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

### Go with OPTION C: Strategic 48-54 Substations

**Why:**

1. **Best value:** More coverage than 36, more affordable than 72
2. **Data-driven:** Deploy more where crime is higher
3. **Flexible:** Can adjust as crime patterns change
4. **Defensible:** Shows you're smart, not just throwing money around
5. **Strong message:** "At least one everywhere, two where needed most"

**Deployment:**
- **24 ZIP codes get 1 substation** (lower crime, smaller areas)
- **12 ZIP codes get 2 substations** (higher crime, larger areas)
- **Total: 48 substations**

Or adjust to 50-54 based on specific neighborhood analysis.

---

## üìã WHAT TO DO NEXT

### IMMEDIATE:

1. **Decide your number:**
   - 36 (safe, proven)
   - 48-54 (strategic - recommended)
   - 72 (bold, expensive)

2. **If you choose 72:**
   - Prepare defense for "why TWO everywhere?"
   - Confirm LMPD can function with 41.6% in substations
   - Have data showing need for 2 per ZIP

3. **If you choose 48-54:**
   - Identify which 12 ZIPs get 2 substations
   - Base on crime data, population density, geography
   - Prepare to explain selection methodology

4. **Update budget documents:**
   - Reflect correct number and cost
   - Update deployment timeline
   - Revise messaging throughout

---

## üéØ BOTTOM LINE

**You asked if you can do 2 per ZIP code (72 total). The answer is YES.**

**Budget:** ‚úÖ Fits ($14.4M within $129.2M patrol budget)  
**Staffing:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Tight (432 officers = 41.6% of force)  
**Feasibility:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible but aggressive

**But consider Option C (48-54 strategic) instead:**
- Covers all neighborhoods
- Extra coverage where needed most
- Costs $9.6M vs $14.4M (saves $4.8M/year)
- Uses 288 vs 432 officers (144 fewer)
- More defensible strategy

**Message comparison:**

**72 stations:** "Two everywhere"  
**48 stations:** "At least one everywhere, two where needed most"

The second message is smarter, more strategic, and easier to defend.

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** Decision needed on final number

**Your call: Go bold with 72, strategic with 48, or conservative with 36. All are feasible. But 48 might be the sweet spot.**
