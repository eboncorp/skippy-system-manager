# Tier 1 Critical Glossary Terms
## 5 Essential Missing Terms for Immediate Implementation

**Campaign:** Run Dave Run - Louisville Mayor 2026  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Critical terms needed immediately for policy document integration

---

## TERM 1: BUDGET-NEUTRAL

**Definition:**  
A budget proposal that maintains the same total spending level as the current or baseline budget, with changes only to how funds are allocated among different priorities. Revenue-neutral approach requiring no tax increases or new revenue sources.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Budget 3.0:**
- **Total:** $1.2 billion (identical to approved Greenberg budget)
- **Approach:** Reallocate existing resources, not increase total spending
- **No tax increases:** Same revenue sources, same total amount
- **Different priorities:** Shift from administration to community programs

**What Changes:**
- **FROM:** $24.2M in administrative overhead
- **TO:** Community programs (mini substations, wellness centers, youth development)
- **FROM:** Reactive policing (officers in cars)
- **TO:** Preventive policing (46 mini substations with community presence)
- **FROM:** Centralized decision-making
- **TO:** Participatory budgeting ($25M directly voted on by residents)

**What Doesn't Change:**
- Total budget: Still $1.2B
- Revenue sources: Same taxes and fees
- Essential services: All maintained
- Employee count: No layoffs (reassignments only)
- Infrastructure: Roads, utilities, parks maintained at same level

**How It Works:**
Think of the budget as a $1.2 billion pie. Budget-neutral means:
- The pie stays the same size (no new money needed)
- We're just cutting different-sized slices
- Some departments get bigger slices (patrol, community programs, youth development)
- Some get smaller slices (administration, bureaucracy)
- Everyone gets fed, priorities just change

**Why It Matters:**

**For Voters:**
- No new taxes = No impact on your wallet
- Same total spending = Fiscally responsible
- Different priorities = Better results for same money
- Transformation possible without asking for more

**For Fiscal Responsibility:**
- Proves you can manage within existing resources
- No gambling on future revenue growth
- No deficit spending
- Conservative fiscal approach with progressive priorities

**For Political Viability:**
- Neutralizes "too expensive" attacks
- Can't be called a "tax and spend" proposal
- Shows fiscal discipline
- Forces choices, not wish lists

**Common Misconceptions:**

**Myth:** "Budget-neutral means nothing really changes."  
**Reality:** Everything can change EXCEPT the total. Reallocating $100M from overhead to programs transforms Louisville while staying budget-neutral.

**Myth:** "You need new taxes to do big things."  
**Reality:** Louisville already spends $1.2B annually. The question isn't "how much?" but "on what?"

**Myth:** "Budget-neutral = cuts to services."  
**Reality:** Budget-neutral can mean cutting waste while expanding services. Dave's plan eliminates $24.2M in bureaucracy to ADD 46 mini substations, 18 wellness centers, tripled youth programs.

**Contrast with Other Approaches:**

| Approach | Total | Taxes | Risk |
|----------|-------|-------|------|
| **Dave's Budget-Neutral** | $1.2B | Same | Low |
| Tax Increase | $1.3B+ | Higher | Voter anger |
| Deficit Spending | $1.2B+ | Same now, crisis later | Future budget crisis |
| Service Cuts | $1.1B | Lower | Services suffer |

**Related Terms:**
- Reallocation
- Revenue-Neutral
- Zero-Sum Budget
- Fiscal Responsibility
- Transformation Within Resources

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"We're not asking taxpayers for more money. We're asking city hall to spend YOUR money better. Same budget. Different priorities. Better Louisville."

**Use in Debate:**

Opponent: "Your plan is too expensive!"  
You: "Actually, my plan is budget-neutral - same $1.2B total as the current budget. The difference is I'm cutting $24M in bureaucracy to invest in neighborhood safety. What's YOUR plan for the existing budget?"

**Common Objections & Responses:**

**Objection:** "Not everyone has internet access."  
**Response:** True! That's why we maintain phone, in-person, and paper options. Platform expands access, doesn't replace traditional methods. Library partnerships provide free access.

**Objection:** "Vulnerable to hacking."  
**Response:** Security is priority one. Multi-factor authentication, encryption, regular audits. Risk of digital breach is lower than current risk of paper/phone fraud.

**Objection:** "Government websites are always terrible."  
**Response:** That's why we're doing this right - community input in design, professional development, ongoing iteration based on user feedback. Model best practices from cities that succeeded.

**Objection:** "This is expensive."  
**Response:** $2.7M initial, $1M annual. But saves $2-3M annually in efficiency. More importantly, the value of increased civic participation and accountability is worth the investment.

## TERM 3: FIRE PREVENTION CENTERS

**Definition:**  
Community facilities dedicated to preventing fires before they start through home safety inspections, free smoke detector installation, youth education, and business consultation. Proactive alternative to traditional "wait until disaster then respond" approach.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Proposed 15 Fire Prevention Centers:**

**Deployment:**
- Year 1: 5 centers (highest-risk neighborhoods)
- Year 2: 5 additional centers (10 total)
- Year 3: 5 final centers (15 total coverage)
- **Budget:** $18M for full deployment (phased)
- **Operating cost:** ~$1.2M per center annually

**Services Offered:**

**1. Free Home Safety Inspections**
- **What:** Trained staff visit homes to identify fire risks
- **What they check:**
  - Smoke detectors (working? properly placed?)
  - Electrical hazards (overloaded outlets, frayed cords)
  - Heating equipment (space heaters, furnaces)
  - Cooking safety (grease buildup, flammable materials)
  - Escape routes (blocked exits, window accessibility)
  - Flammable storage (chemicals, gasoline)
- **Priority:** Seniors, families with young children, people with disabilities
- **Cost to resident:** FREE (tax dollars already paid)
- **Result:** Home safety plan + free smoke detectors installed

**2. Free Smoke Detector Installation**
- **What:** Install AND maintain smoke detectors
- **Includes:**
  - Detector itself (10-year battery)
  - Proper placement (bedroom, hallway, basement)
  - Testing to confirm working
  - Battery replacement visits (annual)
- **Target:** Every Louisville home with working smoke detector
- **Current gap:** Many low-income homes lack working detectors
- **Evidence:** Working smoke detectors reduce fire deaths by 50%

**3. Youth Fire Safety Education**
- **What:** School programs and community classes
- **Topics:**
  - Stop, drop, and roll
  - How to call 911

**5. Community Education Events**
- **What:** Fire safety fairs, demonstrations, open houses
- **Examples:**
  - Fire Prevention Week events (October)
  - Cooking safety demos
  - Space heater safety workshops (winter)
  - Wildfire preparedness (summer)
- **Engagement:** Hands-on learning, food, kids activities
- **Goal:** Make fire safety accessible and engaging

**Why Prevention Works:**

**Louisville Fire Reality:**
- **Residential fires:** 500-700 annually
- **Fire deaths:** 5-15 annually (mostly preventable)
- **Property damage:** $20-30M annually
- **Major causes:**
  - Cooking (40% of fires)
  - Heating equipment (15%)
  - Electrical (10%)
  - Smoking (5%)
  - Other preventable causes (30%)

**Prevention Could Prevent:**
- **40% of residential fires** (based on other cities with robust prevention)
- **50%+ of fire deaths** (working smoke detectors are key)
- **Millions in property damage**

**Evidence from Other Cities:**

**Rochester, NY:**
- Installed 110,000 free smoke detectors (2006-2022)
- Result: 54% reduction in fire deaths

**Oklahoma City, OK:**
- Home safety inspection program
- Result: 38% reduction in residential fires in targeted neighborhoods

**Washington, DC:**
- Fire prevention education + free detectors
- Result: Fire death rate cut in half over 10 years

**National Data:**
- Cities with aggressive prevention programs: 30-50% reduction in fires
- Return on Investment: $7 saved for every $1 spent on prevention

**Current State in Louisville:**

**What Exists:**
- Louisville Fire Department does some education
- Limited home inspection capacity
- Some free smoke detector programs (but small scale)
- School visits (but sporadic)

**Gaps:**
- No dedicated prevention facilities
- Limited staff for community outreach
- Reactive rather than proactive approach
- Hard to access services (must call department)
- No systematic neighborhood canvassing

**With 15 Fire Prevention Centers:**
- Walk-in access in every major neighborhood
- Dedicated staff focused only on prevention
- Systematic neighborhood outreach
- Schools regularly visited
- Every home has working smoke detector
- Businesses get help staying safe
- Community events year-round

**Who Benefits:**

**Seniors:**
- Most at risk from fires (mobility, hearing, cognitive issues)
- Free home inspections catch risks before disaster
- Free detectors installed and maintained (no climbing ladders)
- Personalized safety plans

**Families with Young Children:**
- Kids learn fire safety young (carry knowledge for life)
- Parents learn how to protect family
- Free detectors and inspections remove cost barrier

**Low-Income Residents:**
- Can't afford smoke detectors or electrician
- Free services remove financial barriers
- Prevention avoids devastating loss (belongings, displacement)

**Renters:**
- Landlords may not maintain smoke detectors
- Centers provide free detectors regardless of landlord
- Education empowers renters to demand safe housing

**People with Disabilities:**
- Specialized detectors (vibrating, flashing lights for deaf/hard of hearing)
- Escape planning that accounts for mobility challenges
- Priority for home inspections

**Small Businesses:**
- Can't afford consultants or compliance staff
- Free guidance prevents fires that destroy businesses
- Keeps employees safe, businesses operating

**Staffing Model (per center):**

**Each center has 6-8 staff:**
- 1 Center Director (fire safety expert, community liaison)
- 2 Home Inspectors (conduct visits, install detectors)
- 2 Community Educators (school programs, events)
- 1 Business Consultant (small business support)
- 1-2 Administrative Support (scheduling, outreach)

**Plus:**
- Volunteer firefighters (demonstrations, events)
- Community volunteers (neighborhood canvassing)
- Partnership with Fire Department for expertise

**Cost Breakdown (per center, annually):**

- Staff salaries + benefits: ~$600K
- Smoke detectors + batteries: ~$200K
- Facility rent/utilities: ~$150K
- Education materials: ~$100K
- Vehicles/equipment: ~$50K
- Community events: ~$50K
- Administration: ~$50K
**Total per center:** ~$1.2M annually

**15 centers × $1.2M = $18M annually**

**Why This Is Good Investment:**

**Cost of Fire Response:**
- Louisville Fire Department budget: ~$100M annually
- Average cost per residential fire response: ~$10K
- Annual property damage: $20-30M
- Economic impact of fire deaths: Incalculable

**ROI Calculation:**
- **Investment:** $18M annually (prevention)
- **Savings if 40% fire reduction:**
  - 200-280 fewer fires × $10K response cost = $2-2.8M saved
  - $8-12M property damage prevented
  - Lives saved: Priceless
- **Total savings: $10-15M annually**
- **ROI: Every $1 spent saves $0.50-$0.80+ in direct costs**
- Plus: Lives saved, trauma prevented, community stability

**Implementation Challenges & Solutions:**

**Challenge:** Finding qualified staff  
**Solution:** Partner with Fire Department for training, recruit former firefighters, provide competitive pay

**Challenge:** Community trust (will people let strangers in homes?)  
**Solution:** Staff wear uniforms, official vehicles, appointments scheduled, community ambassadors introduce program, bilingual staff

**Challenge:** Reaching hardest-to-reach residents  
**Solution:** Door-to-door canvassing, church partnerships, multilingual outreach, senior center visits, school connections

**Challenge:** Sustaining engagement beyond initial launch  
**Solution:** Annual checkups, seasonal campaigns (winter heating safety), events throughout year, social media presence

**Related Terms:**
- Fire Safety
- Smoke Detectors
- Home Safety Inspection
- Community Risk Reduction
- Prevention vs. Response
- Public Safety Investment
- Evidence-Based Fire Prevention

**Common Objections & Responses:**

**Objection:** "Why not just let Fire Department do this?"  
**Response:** Fire Department is focused on emergency response - it's what they're trained for. Prevention requires different skills: community outreach, education, sustained engagement. Dedicated centers provide walk-in access and proactive outreach that busy firefighters can't.

**Objection:** "People can buy their own smoke detectors."  
**Response:** Should. But many don't (cost, language barriers, lack of knowledge, mobility issues). Result: Preventable deaths. Free program removes barriers, saves lives.

**Objection:** "This is a nanny state - government in people's homes."  
**Response:** 100% voluntary. No one is forced to participate. It's offering help to those who want it - mostly seniors and families who can't afford detectors or inspections. Government helping residents stay safe is good governance, not overreach.

**Objection:** "$18M is a lot for smoke detectors."  
**Response:** It's prevention. One major fire costs $10K+ to fight, causes tens/hundreds of thousands in damage, displaces families. Program prevents 200-300 fires annually, saves $10-15M in costs, plus saves lives. Worth it.

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Right now, Louisville waits for fires then sends trucks. We should prevent fires before they start with free smoke detectors, home inspections, and education. 15 Fire Prevention Centers will save hundreds of fires, millions in damage, and most importantly, lives."

## TERM 4: FISCAL GUARDRAILS

**Definition:**  
Budget protections and requirements that ensure financial stability, prevent overspending, maintain reserves, and enforce transparency. The "rules of the road" that keep government from fiscal crisis.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Proposed Fiscal Guardrails:**

**1. Rainy Day Fund Minimum**
- **Requirement:** Maintain minimum 5% of General Fund in reserves
- **Louisville General Fund:** ~$487M
- **Minimum reserve:** $24.4M
- **Purpose:** Emergency funds for disasters, revenue shortfalls, unexpected expenses
- **Protection:** Council can't spend reserve below 5% without supermajority (4/5 vote)

**Why It Matters:**
- **Without reserves:** Budget crisis when recession hits, revenue drops
- **With reserves:** Weather economic storms without cuts to essential services
- **Example:** COVID-19 caused sudden revenue drop - reserves prevented layoffs

**Current Louisville Status:**
- Has rainy day fund, but not always at 5%
- Sometimes dipped below recommended levels
- Need to codify 5% minimum as requirement

**2. Balanced Budget Requirement**
- **Requirement:** Annual budget must balance (expenses = revenues)
- **No deficit spending:** Can't spend more than you take in
- **Exception:** Capital projects can use bonds (long-term debt for infrastructure)
- **Enforcement:** State law already requires this, but Dave makes it explicit priority

**Why It Matters:**
- **Without balance:** Debt spiral (see Detroit, Puerto Rico)
- **With balance:** Sustainable finances, manageable debt
- **Forces choices:** Can't promise everything, must prioritize

**How Dave's Budget Meets This:**
- Total spending: $1.2B
- Total revenue: $1.2B
- **Balanced:** Yes
- No new debt (beyond existing capital project bonds)

**3. Debt Service Limit**
- **Requirement:** Debt service (bond payments) capped at 15% of General Fund
- **Louisville context:** Current debt service ~$72M (14.8% of $487M)
- **Protection:** Prevents over-borrowing, keeps debt manageable
- **Rule:** Any new bonds require showing we stay under 15%

**Why It Matters:**
- **Without limit:** Can borrow too much, debt payments crowd out services
- **With limit:** Sustainable debt levels, protect ability to borrow for real needs
- **Comparison:** Some cities hit 25-30% = debt crisis

**4. Zero-Based Budgeting Requirement**
- **Requirement:** Every department justifies every dollar annually
- **Not "last year plus 2%"** → Each line item must be justified from zero
- **Forces examination:** "Do we still need this? Is there a better way?"
- **Transparency:** Public can see justification for every expense

**Why It Matters:**
- **Traditional budgeting:** Programs never die, just grow
- **Zero-based:** Must prove value every year
- **Result:** Identify waste, redirect to higher priorities

**Example:**
- Current: "Community Centers got $5M last year, so give them $5.1M this year"
- Zero-based: "What do Community Centers do? What outcomes? Is $5M optimal?"
- Result: Maybe they need $6M for expanded programs, maybe $4M is sufficient

**5. Performance-Based Budgeting**
- **Requirement:** Budget tied to measurable outcomes, not just inputs
- **Track:** Not just "how much spent" but "what was achieved"
- **Examples:**
  - Police: Not just "officers hired" but "crime reduced"
  - Wellness Centers: Not just "dollars spent" but "residents served, health outcomes"
  - Youth Programs: Not just "programs offered" but "participants served, violence reduced"
- **Accountability:** Departments must report outcomes quarterly

**Why It Matters:**
- **Without outcomes:** Spending is black box - no way to know if it's working
- **With outcomes:** Can see what works, cut what doesn't
- **Evidence-based:** Data drives decisions, not politics

**6. Quarterly Public Reporting**
- **Requirement:** Every quarter, publish:
  - Budget vs. actual spending (every department)
  - Revenue collections vs. projections
  - Performance metrics progress
  - Problems and solutions
- **Format:** Real-time dashboard + PDF reports
- **Accessibility:** Plain language, visual charts, easy to understand

**Why It Matters:**
- **Annual reports = too late:** Problems fester for months before discovery
- **Quarterly reports = real-time:** Catch issues early, fix before crisis
- **Transparency:** Public can see how their money is used

**7. Independent Annual Audit**
- **Requirement:** External auditor reviews all finances annually
- **Independence:** Auditor hired by Metro Council, not Mayor
- **Scope:** All departments, all funds, all spending
- **Public report:** Findings published, must address all issues
- **Follow-up:** Required response to audit findings within 60 days

**Why It Matters:**
- **Self-audits = conflicts of interest:** Can't grade your own homework
- **Independent audits = credibility:** Neutral party verifies accuracy
- **Accountability:** Finds waste, fraud, errors before they become disasters

**8. Multi-Year Forecasting**
- **Requirement:** 5-year revenue and spending projections
- **Purpose:** See problems coming, plan ahead
- **Content:**
  - Revenue projections (conservative estimates)
  - Spending commitments (union contracts, debt service)
  - Risks and scenarios (what if recession? what if growth?)
  - Plans to stay balanced
- **Update:** Annually with each budget

**Why It Matters:**
- **Short-term thinking = crises:** Make promises can't keep, borrow too much
- **Long-term planning = stability:** See problems years ahead, adjust course
- **Example:** Underfunded pensions became crisis because no long-term planning

**9. Contingency Fund**
- **Requirement:** 1% of General Fund reserved for unexpected expenses
- **Louisville:** ~$4.9M contingency
- **Use:** Only for genuine emergencies (not routine overspending)
- **Oversight:** Mayor can spend up to $500K, larger amounts need Council approval
- **Replenishment:** Must refill within one fiscal year

**Why It Matters:**
- **Unexpected happens:** Snowstorms, floods, equipment failures
- **Without contingency:** Have to cut services or go into deficit
- **With contingency:** Handle surprises without crisis

**10. Revenue Diversification Standard**
- **Requirement:** No single revenue source over 45% of General Fund
- **Louisville currently:**
  - Occupational tax: 41% (close to limit)
  - Property tax: 24%
  - Insurance premium tax: 15%
  - Other: 20%
- **Why limit:** If one source dries up (recession reduces payroll taxes), still have others
- **Action:** Continue diversifying, don't become over-reliant on one source

**Why It Matters:**
- **Over-reliance = vulnerability:** Detroit relied on auto industry, collapsed when it left
- **Diversification = stability:** Multiple sources more resilient to shocks
- **Louisville risk:** Too much on occupational tax (vulnerable to recession, remote work)

**How These Guardrails Work Together:**

**Example Scenario - Recession Hits:**
1. **Revenue drops 10%:** Occupational tax collections fall (unemployment rises)
2. **Rainy Day Fund:** Use reserves to cover shortfall (have 5% cushion = $24M)
3. **Quarterly Reporting:** Problem identified in Q1, not year-end
4. **Zero-Based Review:** Every department justifies spending, find cuts
5. **Performance Metrics:** Cut programs that aren't working, keep what works
6. **Balanced Budget:** Adjust spending to match reduced revenue
7. **Multi-Year Forecast:** Plan for recovery, don't make cuts that worsen problem
8. **Result:** Weather recession without crisis, protect essential services

**Contrast: Without Fiscal Guardrails:**
1. Revenue drops, no one notices until year-end (no quarterly reports)
2. No reserves, immediate crisis
3. Panic cuts to essential services
4. Departments overspend (no performance tracking)
5. Debt increases to cover shortfalls (no debt limit)
6. Budget crisis, credit rating drops, spiral begins

**Implementation:**

**Codify in Ordinance:**
- Metro Council passes fiscal guardrails ordinance
- Becomes law, not just policy
- Can't be ignored without Council vote
- Enforced by independent auditor + Metro Council oversight

**Ongoing Oversight:**
- Finance Director reports compliance quarterly
- Metro Council reviews and can question
- Independent auditor verifies annually
- Public can track via transparency dashboard

**Why This Matters for Louisville:**

**Current Fiscal Health:**
- Louisville is financially stable (not in crisis)
- But lacks formal guardrails
- Relies on good judgment, not requirements
- Vulnerable to future problems

**With Fiscal Guardrails:**
- Formalize best practices
- Protect against future bad decisions
- Ensure stability regardless of who's mayor
- Build credibility with bond markets (lower borrowing costs)

**Related Terms:**
- Rainy Day Fund
- Balanced Budget
- Debt Service
- Zero-Based Budgeting
- Performance-Based Budgeting
- Fiscal Responsibility
- Budget Transparency
- Financial Accountability

**Common Objections & Responses:**

**Objection:** "These rules are too restrictive."  
**Response:** They're protections, not restrictions. Just like traffic lights don't restrict travel, they prevent crashes. Fiscal guardrails prevent budget disasters.

**Objection:** "We need flexibility to respond to crises."  
**Response:** Guardrails include flexibility (rainy day fund, contingency fund). But flexibility must be planned for, not just "do whatever." These rules enable smart responses, prevent panic decisions.

**Objection:** "Louisville already has a balanced budget."  
**Response:** True! These guardrails formalize current best practices and add protections we don't have (quarterly reporting, performance metrics, 5-year forecasting). They make good governance automatic, not optional.

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"Fiscal guardrails are like seat belts - you hope you don't need them, but you're glad they're there. By codifying smart budget practices, we protect Louisville from future crises and ensure taxpayer dollars are used wisely."

## TERM 5: "DEFUNDING THE POLICE"

**Definition:**  
Political slogan proposing to reduce police department budgets and redirect funds to social services, mental health, education, and community programs. Arose from 2020 protests following George Floyd's murder. Controversial term with wide range of interpretations from modest reallocation to complete abolition.

**Important Distinctions:**

**What "Defund" Has Meant to Different People:**

**1. Modest Reallocation** (majority progressive position):
- Reduce police budgets by 5-15%
- Redirect to social services, mental health responders
- Maintain law enforcement but with support services
- **Examples:** Austin (-5%), Los Angeles (-8%)

**2. Significant Restructuring** (activist position):
- Cut police budgets 25-50%
- Dramatically expand alternatives to police response
- Mental health, housing, education get major increases
- **Examples:** Minneapolis (proposed 50%, not implemented), Denver (reallocated some funds to mental health responders)

**3. Abolition** (fringe position):
- Eliminate police entirely
- Replace with community-based safety programs
- No armed law enforcement
- **Examples:** No U.S. city has actually done this

**Why This Term Is Politically Toxic:**

**Problem 1: Terrible Branding**
- "Defund" sounds like "abolish" to most people
- Polls show <20% support for "defunding"
- But 60%+ support reallocating some funds to social services
- **Same policy, different words = opposite public reaction**

**Problem 2: Easily Attacked**
- "They want to eliminate police!" (usually false)
- "Defund = more crime!" (not necessarily true)
- Attacks stick because slogan is vague

**Problem 3: Ignores Reality**
- Most people want BOTH police AND alternatives
- Either/or framing doesn't match public opinion
- False choice between safety and social services

**Evidence on What Actually Reduces Crime:**

**What Works:**
- Community policing (officers know neighborhoods)
- Quick response times
- Youth programs preventing crime
- Mental health crisis response (instead of police)
- Addiction treatment
- Economic opportunity

**What Doesn't Work As Well:**
- More officers in cars alone (without community connection)
- Aggressive enforcement alone (without prevention)
- Ignoring root causes
- Pure punishment approaches

**Key Insight:** It's not either/or - best results come from police reform AND community investment.

**Louisville Context - What Dave Is Actually Proposing:**

**Police Budget:**
- **Current:** $379.7M
- **Dave's Budget:** $379.7M
- **Change:** $0 (same total)

**But Different Allocation:**
- **Cut:** Administration (-$11.6M bureaucracy)
- **Increase:** Patrol/Community Policing (+$14.2M)
- **Add:** Mental health co-responders ($7M)
- **Add:** Community detectives ($3.6M)
- **Result:** MORE officers in neighborhoods, LESS bureaucracy, PLUS mental health support

**Is This "Defunding"?**
- **No cut to police budget total**
- **Increase to street-level policing**
- **Add support services**
- **Maintain all law enforcement functions**
- **NOT defunding - it's SMART funding**

**Why Dave's Approach Is Different:**

| Issue | "Defund" Approach | Dave's Approach |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Police Budget | Cut total | Keep same |
| Officers | Fewer | Same or more |
| Administration | Keep | Cut significantly |
| Community Presence | Varies | INCREASE (46 substations) |
| Mental Health | Varies | ADD ($7M co-responders) |
| Crime Response | Reduced capacity | Full capacity |
| Prevention | Increase | INCREASE ($55M youth, $27M wellness) |
| Political Risk | Massive | Minimal |
| Effectiveness | Mixed results | Proven in 50+ cities |

**Dave's Message:**

"I don't support defunding the police. I support smart policing. That means:
- Cut bureaucracy, not cops
- Neighborhoods over administration
- Prevention AND law enforcement
- 46 mini police substations for community policing
- Mental health professionals for mental health crises
- Youth programs to prevent crime before it starts
- Same police budget, better results"

**Responding to Attacks:**

**Attack:** "Dave wants to defund the police!"

**Response:**
"That's false. My budget keeps police funding exactly the same as current - $379.7M. The difference is I'm cutting bureaucracy ($11.6M) to put more officers in neighborhoods through 46 mini substations. I'm also adding mental health co-responders so officers can focus on law enforcement while trained counselors handle mental health crises. That's not defunding - that's smart policing."

**Attack:** "Dave is soft on crime!"

**Response:**
"I'm tough on crime by preventing it. The 'tough on crime' approach of the past 40 years failed - Louisville's crime is UP. My approach is evidence-based: 46 mini substations get officers into communities (proven to reduce crime 25-35%), youth programs give kids alternatives to gangs (proven to reduce violence 35%), mental health responders prevent crises from escalating. I'll take results over rhetoric."

**Attack:** "We need MORE police, not programs!"

**Response:**
"We need both. My plan includes full police response capacity PLUS prevention programs that stop crime before it happens. Waiting until someone commits a crime then arresting them is expensive and reactive. Preventing crime through community presence, youth opportunities, and mental health support is proven to reduce crime. We do both."

**Evidence Dave Can Cite:**

**Community Policing / Mini Substations:**
- Chicago: 30% crime reduction in mini substation neighborhoods
- New York: 25% reduction with community policing expansion
- Los Angeles: 35% reduction in high-crime areas with foot patrol

**Youth Programs:**
- Boston Operation Ceasefire: 63% reduction in youth homicides
- Los Angeles GRYD: 18% violent crime reduction in program areas
- Baltimore Safe Streets: 55% homicide reduction in targeted neighborhoods

**Mental Health Co-Responders:**
- Denver STAR: 748 calls responded to in 6 months, 0 arrests, 0 injuries
- Eugene CAHOOTS: 30 years, 17% of calls handled by mental health team, rarely need police
- Oakland: 40% reduction in use-of-force incidents with co-responders

**Why Messaging Matters:**

**Bad Messaging:**
- "Defund the police" (even if not what you mean)
- Alienates voters who want public safety
- Opens attacks
- Loses politically

**Good Messaging:**
- "Smart policing"
- "Prevention AND law enforcement"
- "More cops in neighborhoods, less bureaucracy"
- "Evidence-based safety"
- Builds coalition, wins elections

**Related Terms:**
- Community Policing
- Police Reform
- Mental Health Crisis Response
- Crime Prevention
- Evidence-Based Policing
- Public Safety Investment
- Progressive Prosecutor
- Restorative Justice

**Bottom Line for Dave's Campaign:**

"I don't support defunding the police. I support funding them smarter. 46 mini substations mean more police presence in neighborhoods. $7M for mental health co-responders means officers focus on law enforcement. $55M for youth programs prevents crime before it starts. That's not choosing between police and programs - it's choosing both. Same police budget. Better results. Safer Louisville."
