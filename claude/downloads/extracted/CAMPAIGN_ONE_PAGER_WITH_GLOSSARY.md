## SAME BUDGET. SMARTER PRIORITIES.

**Total Budget: $1.025 billion**  
(Same total as Mayor Greenberg's approved 2025-2026 <span class="glossary-term" data-term="fiscal-year" title="The 12-month period used for budgeting and financial reporting. In Louisville Metro, the fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.">fiscal year</span> budget)

**The Difference:** Not how much we spend. HOW we spend it.

## THE 30-SECOND PITCH

**Greenberg's approach:** Traditional <span class="glossary-term" data-term="reactive-policing" title="Law enforcement strategy that responds to crimes after they occur, rather than preventing crime proactively through community engagement.">reactive policing</span> after crime happens.  
**My approach:** Police IN neighborhoods, prevention BEFORE crime starts.

**Greenberg's approach:** Programs scattered, bureaucracy bloated.  
**My approach:** <span class="glossary-term" data-term="community-wellness-center" title="Multi-service facilities providing primary healthcare, mental health services, and addiction treatment in one accessible neighborhood location. Louisville proposal includes 18 centers at $2.5M annually each.">Community wellness centers</span>, lean administration.

**Greenberg's approach:** Top-down decisions.  
**My approach:** YOU help decide neighborhood priorities through <span class="glossary-term" data-term="participatory-budgeting" title="Democratic process where community members directly decide how to allocate portions of public budget through community meetings and voting. Used successfully in 3,000+ cities worldwide.">participatory budgeting</span>.

**Same total cost. Revolutionary results.**
