## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### What Opponents DON'T Have

**Typical Campaign:**
- Policy page with bullet points
- Maybe a PDF white paper
- Vague promises
- "Details to come"
- No glossary
- Voters left to Google terms themselves

**Dave's Campaign:**
- Comprehensive policy documents
- Every term hyperlinked and defined
- 400+ term educational glossary
- Louisville-specific context for everything
- Evidence from 50+ cities
- Volunteer training materials
- Self-contained educational ecosystem

**Result:** Dave appears dramatically more prepared, professional, and serious about governance.

---

### Media Differentiation

**Typical Coverage:**
"Candidate proposes community policing reforms..."

**With Dave's Glossary:**
"Biggers' detailed platform, available with comprehensive explanations at rundaverun.org, proposes 46 mini police substations - a model proven to reduce crime 25-35% in over 50 U.S. cities according to his policy documentation..."

**Result:** More detailed, more credible coverage. Glossary becomes source for media.

---

### Debate Performance

**Without Glossary System:**
Opponent: "Your plan is too vague!"
Candidate: "No it's not, it's very detailed..." (defensive)

**With Glossary System:**
Opponent: "Your plan is too vague!"
Dave: "Actually, my plan is the most detailed in Louisville history - 200 pages of documentation, 400+ term glossary, evidence from 50+ cities, all at rundaverun.org. Have you even read it?" (offensive)

**Result:** Opponent looks uninformed, Dave looks prepared.
