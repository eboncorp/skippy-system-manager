    "louisville_context": "Metro Parks operates youth sports leagues, but participation requires fees ($50-150 per season) and often parental involvement that low-income families can't afford. Private youth sports (club teams, travel leagues) cost hundreds or thousands annually, creating sports opportunities stratified by family income. West Louisville youth often lack access to quality sports programs, contributing to inactivity and limiting college scholarship opportunities that sports can provide.",
    "why_it_matters": "Youth sports keep kids active and healthy, provide mentoring and structure, and offer pathways to college scholarships—but only if accessible regardless of family income. When quality sports programs are available only to families who can pay, sports become another arena where privilege compounds. Free or low-cost youth sports in underserved neighborhoods are violence prevention and youth development investments.",

    "dave_proposal": "Dave will eliminate fees for youth sports programs in neighborhoods with median incomes below $40,000, funded within the $8 million Metro Parks budget increase. He'll expand youth sports programming in West Louisville, ensuring every neighborhood has accessible basketball, soccer, and other programs. Community Wellness Centers will partner with schools and parks to operate sports programs year-round.",
