## SCENARIO 1: KEISHA - SINGLE MOM IN RUSSELL

### BEFORE (Current Approach)

**6:30 AM - Monday Morning**

Keisha wakes up in her Russell neighborhood home. She's worried because last night someone broke into cars on her street—again. She called 911 at 2 AM. Police arrived at 2:35 AM, 35 minutes later. The thieves were long gone.

Her 14-year-old son Marcus is still asleep. School doesn't start until 8:30, but there's nowhere for him to go after school except hang out with older kids she doesn't trust. She works until 6 PM at the hospital. Marcus is on his own from 3:30-6:30 PM—the exact hours when youth violence peaks.

She drives him to Shawnee High School even though it's only 8 blocks away—too worried about his safety to let him walk. There's a bus, but it's often late and the stops feel unsafe.

At work, Keisha's mind isn't fully on her job. She's worried about Marcus. What's he doing right now? Is he safe? Will he make the same bad choices his cousin did?

**6:00 PM - Monday Evening**

She gets home to find Marcus playing video games. "How was your day?" she asks. He shrugs. No homework done. No dinner started. Just...existing. She knows he's not a bad kid. He just has too much unsupervised time and not enough positive options.

That night, she hears sirens—another shooting, two streets over. She triple-checks the locks, knowing police response times mean she's basically on her own if something happens. She tries to sleep but mostly worries about tomorrow.

This is her daily reality.

---

### AFTER (Dave's Plan - Year 2)

**6:30 AM - Monday Morning**

Keisha wakes up to birds chirping, not sirens. Car break-ins have dropped 60% in Russell since the mini police substation opened on West Muhammad Ali 18 months ago. She actually knows Officer Williams and Officer Chen—they're the regular beat cops who walk past her house every morning and evening. They know her by name. They know Marcus.

Last month when someone tried to break into cars, Officer Williams was there in 90 seconds. The would-be thief was caught red-handed. Word spread quickly: Don't mess with cars in Russell anymore.

**7:30 AM - Monday Morning**

Marcus walks to school now. Keisha still worries—she's a mom—but the streets feel safer. The mini substation is right there. Officers on foot. Neighbors actually sit on porches again. The walk to school has become a social time where Marcus sees friends and neighbors.

Plus, Marcus is excited about going to school. He's in the new after-school program at the California Community Center—funded by Louisville's enhanced youth violence prevention budget. He's learning video production and just got accepted into a summer job program that pays $15/hour. He'll work at a local tech company learning actual job skills.

**3:30 PM - Monday Afternoon**

Instead of Marcus being home alone, he's at the after-school program from 3:30-6:00 PM. Homework help. Mentorship. Sports. Video production. He's making friends with kids who have goals, not kids getting in trouble.

The program is free for families like Keisha's—funded by the $35 million youth violence prevention budget. She pays nothing. Marcus gets supervision, skill-building, and a sense of purpose.

**6:00 PM - Monday Evening**

Keisha gets home to find Marcus excited about a video project he's working on. He shows her what he's learning. His grades are up. His attitude is better. He's talking about college—something she didn't dare dream about before.

And when she needed help with her own anxiety and depression—years of living in a dangerous neighborhood take a toll—she went to the new Russell-area Wellness Center on West Broadway. Free counseling. Mental health support. No judgment. No long wait times. Just help when she needed it.

That night, she actually sleeps. The difference between 35-minute police response times and 2-minute response times is the difference between constant fear and actual safety. Between feeling abandoned and feeling protected.

**This is what transformation looks like.**

## SCENARIO 2: JAMES - SENIOR CITIZEN IN THE SOUTH END

### BEFORE (Current Approach)

**9:00 AM - Wednesday**

James, 73, lives alone in his South End home on Gaulbert Avenue. His wife died two years ago. His kids live out of state. He's increasingly isolated and increasingly worried about his safety.

Last month, someone tried to break into his house in broad daylight. He called 911. Police arrived 28 minutes later—the suspect was long gone. The officer was apologetic: "We're spread too thin, sir. We're doing our best."

James feels forgotten. The city seems focused on downtown and the East End. The South End feels like an afterthought.

His smoke detectors are old. He knows he should replace them but doesn't know how. His neighbor's house caught fire last year—terrible tragedy. Could have been prevented with working smoke detectors and a fire escape plan.

He's also dealing with high blood pressure and diabetes, but the nearest clinic is far and transportation is hard. He misses doctors appointments. His health deteriorates slowly. Nobody checks on him regularly.

At night, he watches TV and worries. About his health. About his safety. About being alone.

**This is too many Louisville seniors' reality.**

---

### AFTER (Dave's Plan - Year 3)

**9:00 AM - Wednesday**

James wakes up in his South End home feeling more secure than he has in years. The mini police substation on Preston Highway opened 18 months ago—just 8 blocks away. Officer Rodriguez walks past his house twice a day. They chat. She checks on him. He's not just a potential 911 call—he's a neighbor she knows by name.

Break-ins in his area are down 55%. Response times average under 4 minutes. James feels safe in his own home for the first time in years.

**10:00 AM - Wednesday**

James has a visit from the South End Fire Prevention Center team. They're doing free home safety checks for seniors—part of Louisville's new fire prevention initiative. They install new smoke detectors (free), check his heating system, create a fire escape plan, and give him a contact card for monthly check-ins.

Last year in Louisville, seniors died in fires at 5x the rate of younger residents. This program is designed to change that. James now has working smoke detectors, a plan, and people who care.

**2:00 PM - Wednesday**

James takes the TARC bus to the new South End Wellness Center on Bardstown Road. It opened last year. He has a regular appointment with a nurse practitioner for his diabetes and blood pressure—free, no long wait, friendly staff. They've connected him with a meal delivery program and a senior walking group.

He's not isolated anymore. He has appointments. He has a walking group. He has people who check on him. His health has actually improved because he's getting consistent care.

**6:00 PM - Wednesday Evening**

James has dinner with his walking group at a neighborhood restaurant. They meet twice a week now—something they organized through the South End's participatory budgeting process. The community voted to fund a "Seniors Stay Connected" program with part of their $1 million budget. James helped choose the priority.

He feels like he matters. Like his neighborhood matters. Like Louisville hasn't forgotten the South End.

That night, he sleeps soundly. The difference between living in fear and living with dignity.

**This is what transformation looks like for seniors.**

## SCENARIO 3: MARIA - SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN THE HIGHLANDS

### BEFORE (Current Approach)

**8:00 AM - Saturday**

Maria opens her small café on Bardstown Road in the Highlands. She loves her business but is increasingly frustrated with safety issues that hurt her bottom line.

Last month, someone smashed her window at 3 AM to steal the cash register—which only had $50 in it. Cost to repair: $800. Police arrived 25 minutes after the alarm went off. They took a report. Nothing came of it.

She's had to install expensive security cameras, better locks, and even considered hiring private security. These costs eat into her already thin margins.

She also worries about her employees. One was assaulted in the parking lot six months ago. Another dealt with an aggressive customer having a mental health crisis. Maria called 911—police came, escalated the situation, ended with an arrest. The sick person needed help, not handcuffs.

Her insurance rates keep rising because of break-ins in the area. She's considering closing the café early instead of staying open until 10 PM—losing evening business because of safety concerns.

**This is what struggling to survive looks like.**

---

### AFTER (Dave's Plan - Year 3)

**8:00 AM - Saturday**

Maria opens her Highlands café with a smile. The mini police substation opened two blocks away on Baxter Avenue last year. Officers Davidson and Patel walk the beat. They stop in for coffee regularly. They know her, know her staff, know her customers.

Break-ins in the Highlands commercial district are down 65%. Maria hasn't had a security incident in 14 months. Her insurance rates actually decreased this year for the first time ever.

**11:00 AM - Saturday**

A customer appears to be having a mental health crisis. Instead of calling 911 and getting just police, Maria calls the Highlands Wellness Center mobile crisis team. Within 12 minutes, a mental health professional arrives with a supporting officer. They de-escalate calmly, connect the person with services, and everyone leaves safely.

No arrest. No trauma. Just professional crisis intervention. The customer gets help. Maria's café stays calm. Her other customers barely notice.

This is what co-responder programs do.

**3:00 PM - Saturday**

Maria meets with other Highlands business owners to vote on how to spend their district's $1 million participatory budget. They're deciding between upgraded street lighting, small business grants, or enhanced cleanup programs.

She feels heard. She has a vote that actually matters. City government isn't something that happens to her—it's something she participates in.

**8:00 PM - Saturday Evening**

The café is busy until 10 PM now. Customers feel safe walking the Highlands at night. Officers on foot patrol. Good lighting (funded by last year's participatory budget). A thriving nighttime economy.

Maria's revenue is up 30% compared to two years ago. Safe neighborhoods are good for business. She's even thinking about opening a second location.

That night, she goes home tired but satisfied. Her business is thriving. Her neighborhood is safe. Louisville is working.

**This is what transformation looks like for small business.**

## SCENARIO 4: DEVON - TEENAGER IN SHAWNEE

### BEFORE (Current Approach)

**3:30 PM - Friday Afternoon**

Devon, 16, gets out of Shawnee High School. He's a good kid—smart, funny, wants to go to college. But he has nowhere to go until his mom gets home at 6:30 PM.

His neighborhood has limited options. No after-school programs nearby. No jobs for teens. No mentorship programs. Just...time. Empty, dangerous time.

His friends are getting involved in things he knows he shouldn't. One got shot last month. Another got arrested. Devon wants something different, but he doesn't see a path forward.

He heads home, does homework, plays video games, tries to stay out of trouble. But temptation is everywhere. Older kids offer quick money for small "jobs." College feels impossible—too expensive, too far away, for kids like him.

At night, he hears gunshots. He's desensitized to it now. Just another night in Shawnee.

**This is what too many Louisville teens face.**

---

### AFTER (Dave's Plan - Year 2)

**3:30 PM - Friday Afternoon**

Devon gets out of Shawnee High and walks three blocks to the new Shawnee Youth Center—opened 18 months ago as part of Louisville's $35 million youth violence prevention investment.

**3:45 PM - 5:30 PM: After-School Program**

Homework help with actual tutors who care. College prep. SAT practice. Devon is learning what he needs to get into college—and learning that college is actually possible for kids like him.

Plus: Sports leagues, art classes, music production, video game design. All free. All in a safe, supervised environment.

**5:30 PM - 6:00 PM: Mentorship**

Devon meets with his mentor, Marcus—a University of Louisville student who grew up in Shawnee, went to college, and came back to give back. They talk about college applications, scholarships, life goals.

For the first time, Devon sees a path forward. Not vague dreams. Actual, concrete steps: graduate high school (on track), apply for scholarships (mentor helping), go to U of L (affordable with aid), get degree (possible), get good job (real).

**Summer Plans:**

Devon already has a summer job lined up through the youth employment program: $15/hour working at a local tech company learning database management. It's not just money—it's skills, resume-building, networking.

40 hours a week. Supervised by professionals. Paid decent wages. Building a future instead of just surviving.

**6:00 PM - Friday Evening**

Devon heads home feeling good. His grades are up. He has a plan. He has support. He has OPTIONS.

His friend who got shot? He's now in the same program. Getting help. Staying out of trouble. Actually healing.

That night, Devon does homework for the SAT. He's applying to U of L and UK. His mentor says he has a real shot. College feels possible. His future feels real.

**This is what transformation looks like for young people.**

## SCENARIO 5: OFFICER JENNIFER MARTINEZ - LMPD

### BEFORE (Current Approach)

**7:00 AM - Thursday**

Officer Martinez starts her shift at one of Louisville's two main precincts. She covers a huge area—basically half of Louisville. She doesn't really "know" any neighborhood. She drives through them, responding to calls.

Her first call: domestic disturbance. High stress. No existing relationship with the family. She does her best, but it's reactive.

Second call: mental health crisis. She's not a mental health professional, but she's the only one available. She tries to de-escalate, but the person needs clinical help she can't provide. It ends in an arrest—which she knows isn't the right outcome, but what else can she do?

Third call: break-in reported 40 minutes ago. She arrives. Suspects long gone. Takes report. Knows it probably won't lead anywhere.

By lunch, she's already exhausted. Driving from crisis to crisis, never really making a difference, always feeling like she's too late.

**6:00 PM - Thursday Evening**

Her shift ends. She's burned out. This isn't the job she signed up for. She wanted to help her community. Instead, she's a reactive crisis responder in areas where nobody knows her and nobody trusts her.

She's considering leaving LMPD. The turnover is getting worse. New officers aren't staying. Experienced officers are exhausted.

**This is the current reality for too many Louisville officers.**

---

### AFTER (Dave's Plan - Year 2)

**7:00 AM - Thursday**

Officer Martinez starts her shift at the Russell mini police substation—her permanent assignment for the past 18 months. She knows this neighborhood. She knows residents by name. They know her.

She walks her beat—same streets every day. She stops at Mr. Johnson's corner store for coffee. He tells her about some teens who've been hanging around looking for trouble. She knows those teens. She connects them with the after-school program. Problem solved before it became a crime.

She stops at Ms. Washington's house—the elderly woman who lives alone. Just checking in. Ms. Washington fell last month; Officer Martinez was first on scene in 90 seconds. Ms. Washington now thinks of her as "her" officer.

**11:00 AM - Thursday**

A call comes in: mental health crisis at an apartment nearby. Officer Martinez arrives in 3 minutes—alongside a mental health professional from the Russell Wellness Center. They'd trained together. They work well together.

The mental health professional takes lead. Officer Martinez provides safety backup. Within 30 minutes, the person in crisis is connected with treatment services. No arrest. No trauma. Just help.

**This is what co-responder programs look like in practice.**

**4:00 PM - Thursday Afternoon**

Officer Martinez stops by the after-school program to talk to kids about police careers. She knows many of these kids personally. They're not scared of her—they respect her. She's part of their community.

One teen asks about becoming a police officer. She encourages him. Tells him about the pathway. Gives him her card. "Stay in touch," she says. "We need good people like you."

**6:00 PM - Thursday Evening**

Her shift ends. She's tired but satisfied. She made a difference today. Real connections. Real prevention. Real community relationships.

She's not leaving LMPD. She loves her job now. Her neighborhood is safer. Crime is down 55%. Response times average 2.5 minutes. Community trust is way up.

And her working conditions are better: no more driving all over Louisville, regular schedule, same neighborhood, actual relationships, backup nearby, wellness resources available.

Officer retention in mini substation assignments is up 35% compared to traditional patrol.

**This is what transformation looks like for police officers.**
