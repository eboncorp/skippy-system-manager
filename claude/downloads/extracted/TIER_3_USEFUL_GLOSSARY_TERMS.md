## TERM 1: SITE SELECTION CRITERIA

**Definition:**  
Systematic methodology for choosing locations for public facilities (like mini police substations, wellness centers, or fire prevention centers) based on data-driven factors: crime statistics, geographic coverage, community input, existing infrastructure, accessibility, and demographic need.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Site Selection Criteria for Mini Substations (46 total):**

**Phase 1: Data Analysis**

**Crime Data (40% weight):**
- Violent crime hotspots (homicides, shootings, assaults)
- Property crime rates (theft, burglary, vandalism)
- 911 call volume and density
- Historical crime patterns (5-year trends)
- Time-of-day analysis (when crimes occur)

**Example:** Russell neighborhood has:
- 2.5x city average violent crime rate
- 15,000+ 911 calls annually
- **Result:** High priority for mini substation

**Geographic Coverage (25% weight):**
- Ensure all 6 districts have substations
- Maximum 1.5-mile radius per substation (walkable)
- Fill gaps between existing LMPD facilities
- Avoid clustering in one area

**Goal:** Every Louisville resident within 1.5 miles of a mini substation

**Community Need (20% weight):**
- Population density
- Median income (prioritize underserved areas)
- Elderly population (vulnerable to crime)
- Youth population (prevention opportunity)
- Language diversity (need multilingual officers)

**Example:** West Louisville:
- High population density
- Lower median income ($28K vs. $52K citywide)
- **Result:** Higher priority for substations

**Community Input (10% weight):**
- District Council recommendations

## TERM 3: POSITION REASSIGNMENT

**Definition:**  
Process of moving employees from one role to another within the same organization, typically from positions being eliminated to new positions being created. In Louisville context: moving city employees from administrative positions to frontline community service roles without layoffs.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Position Reassignment Strategy:**

### Overview

**Positions Being Reduced:**
- Mayor's office administration: ~15 positions

- Potential roles: Mini substation supervisor, community liaison, training coordinator

**Step 2: Options Counseling (Month 2-3)**
- Present 2-3 position options to each employee
- Explain duties, location, compensation
- No pressure - employee chooses
- If no good fit: Work with employee on alternatives

**Options for Most Employees:**
1. Frontline position in their current department (preferred)
2. Lateral move to new program (wellness center, youth, etc.)
3. Retirement (if eligible, incentive package offered)
4. External placement assistance (if they want to leave)

**Step 3: Training & Support (Month 3-6)**
- Paid training for new positions
- Mentorship from experienced staff
- Gradual transition (not overnight)
- Check-ins at 30, 60, 90 days

**Example:** Admin officer → Patrol officer (returning to street)

- Ride-along with experienced patrol officer (2 weeks)
- Community policing training (1 week)
- Assigned to mini substation in familiar neighborhood

**Step 4: Implementation (Month 6-12)**
- Employee starts new role
- Ongoing support and coaching
- Performance feedback
- Adjustment period allowed

---

### Union Partnership

**Critical: Work WITH unions, not against**

**FOP (Fraternal Order of Police):**
- Negotiate reassignment process
- Ensure seniority protections
- No loss of pay or benefits
- Voluntary participation where possible

**AFSCME (Government employees):**
- Similar protections
- Retraining paid by city
- Bumping rights preserved
- Grievance process maintained

**Key Principle:** Position reassignment improves work for most employees
- Admin jobs = boring, disconnected
- Frontline jobs = meaningful, community impact
- Most employees WANT to serve people, not push paper

---

### Compensation & Benefits

**No Loss of Pay:**
- Current salary maintained during transition
- Pay increases as normal (union contracts honored)
- Benefits unchanged (health, pension, vacation)

**Transition Support:**
- $2,000 professional development stipend
- Paid training time (not vacation/PTO)
- Relocation assistance if assignment changes (mileage, parking)

**Incentives for Early Adopters:**
- Bonus for volunteering early: $1,000
- Choice of assignment (first picks)
- Recognition as change leaders

**Retirement Incentive:**
- For employees eligible to retire
- Early retirement package: 6 months salary
- Full benefits to age 65 (if under)
- Voluntary - no pressure

---

### Examples by Department

**LMPD:**
- 75 admin officers → choices:
  - Return to patrol (most common)
  - Mini substation assignment (community policing)
  - Training division (if skilled instructor)
  - Community detectives (relationship-building focus)
  - Co-responder team (mental health partnership)

**Mayor's Office:**
- 15 positions → choices:
  - District Council staff (community engagement)
  - Participatory budgeting coordinators
  - Community Safety Taskforce staff
  - Department liaisons (keep coordination function)
  - Some positions kept (essential functions)

**Public Works:**
- Admin staff → choices:
  - Field inspectors (actually inspect infrastructure)
  - 311 response coordinators
  - Community project managers
  - Code enforcement (more inspectors, faster response)

---

### Success Metrics

**For Employees:**
- Job satisfaction surveys (before/after)
- Retention rates (target: >90% stay)
- Career advancement (promotions within 2 years)
- Skills development (training hours)

**For City:**
- Service delivery improvement (faster response, more presence)
- Cost efficiency (reduce overhead, increase impact)
- Community satisfaction (better service = happier residents)
- Budget neutrality maintained (same total compensation)

---

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge:** "I don't want to leave my desk job."  
**Solution:** Voluntary where possible. For essential reassignments, ample support and training. Many find frontline work more rewarding once they try it.

**Challenge:** "I'm too old to learn something new."  
**Solution:** Retirement incentive (if eligible). Or: Training tailored to experience level. Mentorship support. Age is asset (experience, wisdom).

**Challenge:** "This is just mass layoffs with extra steps."  
**Solution:** No - layoffs mean losing your job. Reassignment means keeping your job, just different duties. More job security (new programs expanding, not contracting).

**Challenge:** "Union won't support this."  
**Solution:** Negotiate early. Show this protects members (no layoffs, same pay, better work). Involve union in process design. Most unions prefer reassignment to layoffs.

---

**Evidence from Other Cities:**

**Seattle (Police Admin Reduction):**
- Moved 50 officers from admin to community policing
- Result: No layoffs, improved community relations, union supported

**Los Angeles (Government Restructuring):**
- Reassigned 300+ employees during budget crisis (2009)
- Result: Avoided layoffs, maintained services, 85% employee satisfaction

**Detroit (Post-Bankruptcy Reorganization):**
- Massive position reassignments
- Result: More efficient government, most employees kept jobs

---

**Related Terms:**
- Administrative Bloat
- Reallocation
- Union Contracts
- Workforce Development
- Change Management
- Government Reform

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"We're not laying people off - we're putting them to work serving people. Desk jobs become community jobs. Everyone keeps their pay and benefits. The difference: Meaningful work actually helping Louisville residents."

---

## TERM 4: UNION CONTRACTS / COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

**Definition:**  
Labor agreements negotiated between government and unions representing city employees, determining wages, benefits, working conditions, grievance procedures, and job protections. In Louisville: FOP (police/fire), AFSCME (government workers), others represent ~70% of city employees.

**Louisville Context:**

**Major Unions in Louisville Metro:**

**FOP (Fraternal Order of Police):**
- Represents: LMPD officers, Louisville Fire

- Members: ~2,000 employees
- Contract covers: Similar to FOP
- Multiple locals within Louisville Metro

**Other Unions:**

---

### Dave's Budget Impact on Union Contracts

**Police (FOP):**

**NO CHANGE to total police budget or officer count:**
- Budget stays $379.7M
- Officer positions maintained
- Pay and benefits unchanged

**CHANGE to deployment:**
- Fewer admin positions (by attrition/reassignment)
- More patrol positions (including mini substations)
- Negotiate with FOP on reassignment process
- Voluntary where possible, training provided

**FOP Priorities Dave Addresses:**
- Officers want to do police work, not paperwork (mini substations)
- Safety (community policing = safer for officers)
- Community support (better relations = less risk)
- Overtime reduction (more patrol officers = less burnout)

**Likely Union Support:** High (assuming negotiation goes well)

---

**Government Workers (AFSCME):**

**MIXED IMPACT:**
- Some admin positions reassigned
- Many new positions created (wellness centers, youth programs)
- No layoffs
- Retraining paid by city

**AFSCME Priorities Dave Addresses:**
- Job security (no layoffs)
- Fair wages (maintained or increased)
- Meaningful work (serving community > paperwork)
- Career development (training for new skills)

**Likely Union Support:** Moderate to High (depends on reassignment details)

---

### Union Engagement Strategy

**Phase 1: Pre-Election**
- Meet with union leadership
- Explain vision and commitment to workers
- Listen to concerns
- Build relationships

**Phase 2: Transition (Election to Inauguration)**
- Formal meetings with each union
- Present detailed plans
- Solicit input on implementation
- Begin informal negotiations

**Phase 3: First 100 Days**
- Formal collective bargaining begins (if contracts expiring)
- Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) for changes
- Regular communication (monthly union meetings)
- Address concerns quickly

**Phase 4: Ongoing**
- Quarterly labor-management meetings
- Open-door policy with union reps
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Celebrate wins together

---

### Common Misconceptions

**Myth:** "Unions block all change."  
**Reality:** Unions want what's best for members. If change improves working conditions, they'll support it. The key is negotiation, not dictation.

**Myth:** "Union contracts make government inefficient."  
**Reality:** Contracts provide stability and fairness. Inefficiency comes from bad management, not worker protections.

**Myth:** "You can't reform government with unions."  
**Reality:** Best reforms happen WITH unions. Workers know what's broken and how to fix it. Involve them early.

**Myth:** "Unions always want more money."  
**Reality:** Unions want fair compensation AND good working conditions. Often, improving conditions matters more than small raises.

---

### Dave's Commitment
