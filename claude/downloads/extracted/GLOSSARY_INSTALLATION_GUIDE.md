## üîß Troubleshooting

### Terms Not Showing on Frontend

**Problem:** Uploaded terms but glossary page is blank.

**Solutions:**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Permalinks
2. Click "Save Changes" (doesn't matter if you change anything)
3. This flushes WordPress rewrite rules
4. Visit `/glossary` again

### Import Fails with JSON Error

**Problem:** JSON import shows "Invalid JSON format" error.

**Solutions:**
1. Validate your JSON at jsonlint.com
2. Common issues:
   - Missing commas between objects
   - Extra comma after last item
   - Unescaped quotes in text
   - Missing closing brackets

### Categories Not Showing

**Problem:** Category filter is empty.

**Solutions:**
1. Go to Voter Glossary ‚Üí Categories
2. Verify all 13 categories exist
3. If missing, deactivate and reactivate plugin
4. Check that terms are assigned to categories

### Related Terms Not Linking

**Problem:** Related terms don't show as links.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure related terms use exact term names
2. Related term must be published (not draft)
3. Run the "Process Related Terms Connections" function:
   - Add to functions.php temporarily:
   ```php
   add_action('init', function() {
       if (class_exists('DB_Glossary_Importer')) {
           $importer = new DB_Glossary_Importer();
           $processed = $importer->process_related_terms_connections();
           echo "Processed $processed connections";
       }
   });
   ```
   - Visit any page once
   - Remove the code

### Templates Not Loading

**Problem:** Glossary uses default WordPress templates instead of custom ones.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify template files exist in `/templates/` folder
2. Check file permissions (should be 644)
3. Clear all caches (WordPress, CDN, browser)
4. Try visiting `/glossary/?nocache=1`
