## OPENING SCRIPTS

### Initial Introduction

**Script Version 1 (Standard):**
"Hi, this is [Your Name], a volunteer calling on behalf of Dave Biggers' campaign for mayor. Is this [Voter Name]?"

**Wait for confirmation, then:**

"Great! I'll only take a minute of your time. We're reaching out to voters about the November 5th election. Are you planning to vote in the mayoral race?"

**Script Version 2 (Quick Survey):**
"Hello, is this [Voter Name]? Hi! This is [Your Name], I'm a volunteer with the Dave Biggers campaign, and I'm doing a quick voter survey. Do you have just one minute?"

**Script Version 3 (GOTV - Final Days):**
"Hi [Voter Name], this is [Your Name] calling with the Dave Biggers campaign. Election Day is [days away/tomorrow/today]! Have you made your plan to vote?"

---

## VOTER IDENTIFICATION SCRIPTS

### Basic Voter ID

**After opening:**

"On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being definitely voting for Dave Biggers and 5 being definitely voting for someone else, where would you place yourself?"

**Or more casual:**

"Are you supporting Dave Biggers in this election, or are you still deciding?"

**Record their response and proceed accordingly.**

---

## PERSUASION SCRIPTS BY SUPPORT LEVEL

### UNDECIDED VOTERS (3)

**Discovery:**
"I completely understand - it's important to make an informed decision. Can I share what Dave has accomplished that might help?"

**Wait for "yes" then:**

"In just 4 years, Dave has:

✅ Hired 46 neighborhood officers - and crime is down 23%
✅ Invested $55 MILLION in our schools after years of cuts
✅ Built 18 mental health centers across our city
✅ Created a $15 million participatory budget where residents vote on spending

He's not making promises - these are real results our community is already experiencing."

**Ask:** "What issues matter most to you?"

**Then match to their priority:**

**PUBLIC SAFETY:**
"Dave takes safety seriously. The current mayor promised 100 new officers but only delivered 23. Dave hired 46 neighborhood officers who build relationships in our communities. Crime is down 23% in neighborhoods with these officers. That's real results, not empty promises."

**EDUCATION:**
"Our schools deserve better. The current mayor cut $12 million from education while claiming 'Education First.' Dave invested $55 million. New technology, teacher raises, after-school programs - and test scores are up 15%. He's actually putting our kids first."

**MENTAL HEALTH:**
"Mental health access is crucial. Dave built 18 mental health centers that served over 12,000 residents last year. Real facilities with real professionals providing real care. This isn't a plan - it's already happening."

**ECONOMY/JOBS:**
"Dave's small business grant program helped 500 new businesses open, creating over 2,000 jobs. He's invested in our local economy with real dollars and real support. Main Street is thriving because of his leadership."

**DEMOCRACY/PARTICIPATION:**
"Dave created a $15 million participatory budget where YOU vote on how money gets spent in YOUR neighborhood. Meanwhile, the current mayor cut town halls from 26 to just 4 per year. Dave believes in government BY the people, not above them."

**Close:**
"Based on what you've heard, can Dave count on your vote on November 5th?"

**If STILL UNDECIDED:**
"I understand. What additional information would help you make your decision?"

[Answer their question, then:]

"Can I send you more information via email? And would you be open to another call closer to Election Day?"

**Record: Undecided + specific concerns + follow-up method**

---

### LEANING SUPPORT (2)

**Confirmation:**
"That's great to hear! We really appreciate your support. Can we count on you to vote for Dave on November 5th?"

**If YES:**
"Wonderful! Have you made your plan to vote? Do you know your polling location?"

**Provide voting information, then:**

"One more thing - would you be willing to help us reach other voters? We need volunteers to make phone calls just like this one, or knock on doors in neighborhoods. Would you be interested?"

**If YES to volunteering:**
"That's fantastic! Let me get your email and phone number, and our volunteer coordinator will reach out with details. You're going to make such a difference!"

**If NO to volunteering:**
"No problem! Would you be willing to talk to 2-3 friends or family members about Dave? Personal recommendations are the most powerful thing we have."

### LEANING OPPOSITION (4)

**Respect their position:**

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "I don't vote" / "Politics doesn't matter"
"I hear you - it can feel that way. But local elections directly affect your daily life - roads, schools, safety. Dave's already made real improvements. Worth considering? If you'd like info, check out [URL]. Thanks!"

### "All politicians are the same"
"I get that frustration! That's actually why Dave's different - his record speaks for itself. 46 officers hired, $55M invested, 18 centers built. These aren't promises, they're done. But I understand your skepticism. Thanks for hearing me out."

### "I don't have time to research"
"Totally fair! That's why I'm calling - to save you time. Dave's got a proven track record of [1-2 accomplishments]. Quick visit to [website] has all the details in plain English. Worth a quick look?"

### "Dave didn't help my neighborhood"
"I'm sorry you feel that way. Can you tell me what neighborhood you're in? I'd love to make sure our team knows about your concerns and can share what projects have happened in your area."

**Voter:** "Uh, sure, I guess."

**You:** "Thanks! Are you supporting Dave Biggers in this election, or are you still deciding?"

**Voter:** "Honestly, I haven't really paid attention to local politics. Still deciding."

New computers in every classroom, teachers got raises, after-school programs fully funded. And test scores are up 15%. Real investment in our kids, not just words."
