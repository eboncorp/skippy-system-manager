## THE CORE PROMISE

Same money. Different Louisville.

We're not asking for more resources. We're asking for smarter allocation of the $1.025 billion Louisville already spends. Every dollar currently spent on bureaucracy, reactive policing, and crisis response gets redirected to <span class="glossary-term" data-term="community-policing" title="Policing philosophy emphasizing partnerships between police and community members, focusing on problem-solving and crime prevention rather than reactive law enforcement.">community policing</span>, prevention, and giving neighborhoods real power over local spending.
