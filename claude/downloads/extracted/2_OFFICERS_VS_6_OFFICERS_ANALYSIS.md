**Dave Biggers for Mayor Campaign**  
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** üö® URGENT - DO NOT REDUCE STAFFING

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUDGET DISCREPANCY DISCOVERED

Your campaign documents have conflicting cost figures:

**Implementation Guide says:** $650,000 per station
- Personnel (6 officers): $400,000
- Facilities (rent/utilities): $150,000
- Operations: $50,000
- Vehicles: $50,000
- **TOTAL:** $650,000

**Budget Documents say:** $200,000 per station
- 46 stations √ó $200K = $9.2M
- 36 stations √ó $200K = $7.2M

**This is a 3.25X discrepancy that needs immediate clarification!**

---

## üí∞ COST ANALYSIS: 2 vs 6 OFFICERS

### SCENARIO A: Using $200K Budget Figure

**36 Stations with 6 Officers Each:**
- Annual cost: $7,200,000
- 4-year total: $19,200,000
- Officer allocation: 216 officers (20.8% of current force)
- Coverage: 24/7 with 2 officers per shift

**36 Stations with 2 Officers Each:**
- Annual cost: ~$4,320,000 (estimated)
- 4-year total: ~$11,520,000
- Officer allocation: 72 officers (6.9% of current force)
- Coverage: Limited (12 hours/day OR thin 24-hour coverage)

**Savings:** $2,880,000 per year

---

### SCENARIO B: Using $650K Implementation Figure

**36 Stations with 6 Officers Each:**
- Annual cost: $23,400,000
- 4-year total: $62,400,000
- Officer allocation: 216 officers
- Coverage: Professional 24/7 operation

**36 Stations with 2 Officers Each:**
- Annual cost: ~$13,800,000
- 4-year total: ~$36,800,000
- Officer allocation: 72 officers
- Coverage: Skeleton crew

**Savings:** $9,600,000 per year

## ‚ö†Ô∏è OPERATIONAL IMPACT

### WITH 6 OFFICERS PER STATION (Current Plan)

**Shift Coverage:**
- **Day Shift (7am-3pm):** 2 officers
- **Evening Shift (3pm-11pm):** 2 officers  
- **Night Shift (11pm-7am):** 2 officers
- **Result:** True 24/7 neighborhood presence

**Capabilities:**
‚úÖ Two officers on duty at all times (safety/backup)  
‚úÖ Can respond to calls while maintaining station presence  
‚úÖ Can handle multiple community members simultaneously  
‚úÖ Community events and meetings during all hours  
‚úÖ Professional, effective operation  
‚úÖ Officers can take breaks, lunch, bathroom without closing  
‚úÖ Proven model used in other cities  

---

### WITH 2 OFFICERS PER STATION (Proposed Reduction)

**Shift Coverage Options:**

**Option 1: 12-Hour Shifts**
- **Day Shift (7am-7pm):** 1 officer
- **Night Shift (7pm-7am):** 1 officer
- **Result:** Single officer alone for entire shift

**Option 2: Daytime Only**
- **Day/Evening (7am-7pm):** 2 officers split shifts
- **Night:** Station closed
- **Result:** No overnight presence

**Critical Problems:**

‚ùå **SAFETY ISSUE:** Single officer alone is dangerous
- No backup during confrontations
- Officer safety protocols typically require partners
- FOP (police union) will strongly oppose
- Liability concerns for the city

‚ùå **EFFECTIVENESS ISSUE:** Can't provide real service
- Officer must close station to respond to calls
- Can't handle multiple community members
- No bathroom breaks without closing
- Looks like token gesture

‚ùå **POLITICAL ISSUE:** Gives ammunition to opponents
- "Dave's doing police presence on the cheap"
- "These aren't real substations, they're police kiosks"
- "He's putting officers in danger to save money"
- "This is just for show"

‚ùå **PRACTICAL ISSUE:** Doesn't match proven models
- Boston, LA, Chicago models all use multiple officers
- Single-officer stations haven't shown effectiveness
- Need critical mass for community engagement

---

## üëÆ STAFFING REQUIREMENTS

**Current LMPD Status:**
- Current officers: 1,038
- Authorized capacity: 1,328
- **Below capacity: 290 officers**

**With 36 Stations:**
- 6 officers each = 216 officers needed (20.8% of force)
- 2 officers each = 72 officers needed (6.9% of force)
- Difference: 144 officers

---

## üí° THE REAL QUESTION

**You're asking: "Can we save money by using 2 officers instead of 6?"**

**The answer: Yes, but you shouldn't.**

Here's why:

### 1. **Safety Trumps Savings**

Police officer safety protocols exist for a reason. Officers working alone are:
- More vulnerable to assault
- Less able to handle confrontations
- At higher risk of injury or death
- More likely to use force (no de-escalation partner)

The FOP will fight this. Hard. And they'll be right to.

### 2. **The Savings Aren't Real**

If the program doesn't work because it's understaffed:
- You don't get crime reduction
- Community doesn't trust it
- You get attacked for "failed experiment"
- You've wasted the money entirely

Better to spend $7.2M on 36 effective stations than $4.3M on 36 ineffective ones.

### 3. **You Already Found Savings**

By going from 46 to 36 stations, you already saved:
- $2M annually (using $200K figure)
- $13.9M over 4 years

That's enough. Don't undermine the program by cutting corners on staffing.

### 4. **This Is Your Signature Program**

Mini substations are the centerpiece of your public safety plan. They need to work. Half-staffing them sends the message that you're not serious about community policing.

---

## üéØ BETTER ALTERNATIVES

If you need more budget savings, here are better options:

### Option 1: Reduce Number of Stations (Not Staffing)

**30 stations with 6 officers each:**
- Annual cost: $6,000,000 (saves $1.2M vs 36 stations)
- Still effective operation
- Focus on highest-need neighborhoods
- Professional coverage where deployed

**Better than:** 36 stations with 2 officers each

### Option 2: Phased Staffing Ramp-Up

**Start with 4 officers, scale to 6:**
- Year 1: 4 officers per station (limited hours)
- Year 2-3: Scale up to 6 officers (full 24/7)
- Allows faster deployment with lower initial cost
- Demonstrates success before full investment

### Option 3: Hybrid Model

**Mix of station types:**
- 20 "full service" stations: 6 officers (24/7 coverage)
- 16 "satellite" stations: 3-4 officers (16-hour coverage)
- Focus full-service on highest crime areas
- Satellites provide broader coverage

**Better than:** All stations understaffed

### Option 4: Find Savings Elsewhere

**Don't cut mini substation effectiveness:**
- Reduce from 18 to 15 wellness centers (saves $4.5M)
- Scale back participatory budgeting Year 1 (saves $3M)
- Slower deployment timeline (saves short-term costs)
- Any of these better than undermining core police program

---

## üìä THE MATH YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

Using the $200K per station budget figure:

**Current Plan:**
- 36 stations √ó $200K = $7.2M/year
- Already saved $2M by going from 46 to 36

**If you cut to 2 officers:**
- 36 stations √ó ~$120K = $4.3M/year  
- Save additional $2.9M/year
- **But program won't work**

**Better approach:**
- 30 stations √ó $200K = $6M/year
- Save $1.2M/year
- **Program still works**

**OR:**
- Keep 36 stations √ó $200K = $7.2M/year
- Find $2.9M savings elsewhere
- **Program definitely works**

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO SAY

**Don't say:**
- "We're being efficient with staffing"
- "Two officers can handle it"
- "We're maximizing coverage per dollar"
- "It's better to have more locations with fewer officers"

**Why not:**
- Greenberg will demolish you: "You're putting officers at risk to save money"
- FOP will oppose: "This violates basic officer safety"
- Community will question: "Is this real or just for show?"
- Media will ask: "Why are you doing this on the cheap?"

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO SAY INSTEAD

**If pressed on costs:**
"We're deploying 36 professional mini substations with proper staffing to ensure officer safety and program effectiveness. Each station will have 6 officers providing true 24/7 neighborhood presence. This is based on proven models from Boston, LA, and Chicago. We're not going to undermine this critical program by cutting corners on staffing."

**If asked about savings:**
"We've already made this program more cost-effective by focusing on the 36 residential neighborhoods where families live, rather than wasting resources on P.O. Box zones and business parks. That's smart budgeting - targeting resources where they're needed, not where they're not."

**If asked about officer allocation:**
"216 officers dedicated to neighborhood mini substations represents 20% of our current force - a substantial commitment to community policing. But we're also hiring more officers overall. This isn't reducing police presence; it's redeploying officers from desk jobs and administrative roles to neighborhood engagement."

## üé¨ BOTTOM LINE

**DO NOT reduce to 2 officers per station.**

**The "savings" of $2.9M/year is not worth:**
- Officer safety concerns
- Program ineffectiveness
- Political vulnerability
- Union opposition
- Community skepticism

**You have three good options:**

1. **Keep 36 stations with 6 officers** ($7.2M/year)
   - Best option if you can afford it
   - Full effectiveness
   - Defensible program

2. **Reduce to 30 stations with 6 officers** ($6M/year)
   - Saves $1.2M/year
   - Still effective
   - Strategic placement

3. **Find $2.9M savings elsewhere**
   - Cut wellness centers from 18 to 15
   - Scale back participatory budgeting Year 1  
   - Adjust other programs
   - Keep police program strong

**The WORST option:**
4. **36 stations with 2 officers** ($4.3M/year)
   - Saves money upfront
   - Program fails
   - Political disaster
   - Wastes the entire investment

## üö® URGENT RECOMMENDATION

**KEEP THE 6 OFFICERS PER STATION MODEL**

The mini substations are your signature public safety initiative. They need to work. Half-staffing them to save $2.9M will:

1. Endanger officers
2. Undermine effectiveness
3. Give Greenberg ammunition
4. Anger the police union
5. Make you look cheap and unserious

You already saved $2M by going from 46 to 36 stations. That's enough. Now make sure the 36 you build actually work.

## üìã ACTION ITEMS

### IMMEDIATE:

1. ‚úÖ **Clarify the cost discrepancy**
   - Is it $200K or $650K per station?
   - Get accurate figures from implementation team
   - Reconcile budget documents

2. ‚úÖ **Confirm staffing model**
   - Stick with 6 officers per station
   - Or choose one of the alternative approaches above
   - But DO NOT go to 2 officers per station

3. ‚úÖ **If more savings needed**
   - Reduce number of stations (30 instead of 36)
   - Or find savings in other programs
   - Do not reduce staffing per station

### SHORT-TERM:

4. Meet with FOP to discuss mini substation staffing
5. Review officer safety protocols and requirements
6. Study other cities' mini substation staffing levels
7. Finalize which 30-36 neighborhoods get stations
