## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't see tooltips"
→ Check that CSS file loaded (View Page Source → search for "glossary-term")  
→ Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 → Console tab)  
→ Try refreshing page with Ctrl+F5 (hard refresh)

### "Tooltips look weird"
→ May conflict with other CSS on your site  
→ Check for CSS specificity issues  
→ Try adding `!important` to glossary styles

### "Mobile not working"
→ JavaScript file must be loaded  
→ Check that file path is correct  
→ Test on real device, not just browser resize
