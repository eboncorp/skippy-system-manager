## üîç What Was Wrong?

**Original:** 263 entries  
**Problem:** 172 entries (65.4%) were artifacts, not glossary terms

### Main Issues Found:
- **Section headers scraped as terms:** "What It Is:", "Cost:", "Evidence:" (171 entries)
- **Data fragments without context:** "$15 million", "24/7 coverage" (42 entries)
- **Document metadata:** "Updated: October 13, 2025" (1 entry)

### Example of Removed Artifact:
```json
{
  "name": "What It Is:",
  "definition": "Mini police substations in neighborhoods"
}
```
**Problem:** "What It Is:" is not a term‚Äîit's a section header from your policy docs.

### Example of Legitimate Term (Kept):
```json
{
  "name": "Appropriation",
  "definition": "Money officially allocated by Metro Council for a specific purpose..."
}
```
**Correct:** This defines an actual concept that voters need to understand.
