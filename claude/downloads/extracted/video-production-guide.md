## VIDEO #1: CANDIDATE INTRODUCTION - "Who Is Dave Biggers?"

**Length:** 2:30  
**Format:** Documentary-style with B-roll  
**Locations:** Dave's childhood neighborhood, his home, community locations  

### SCRIPT:

**[OPEN: Black & white photos of Dave as a child]**

**DAVE (Voiceover):**
I grew up three blocks from here. In this neighborhood. My mom worked two jobs - nurse at the hospital, weekend shifts cleaning offices.

**[B-ROLL: Current shots of the neighborhood, Dave walking the streets]**

She taught me something simple: if you see a problem, you fix it. You don't complain. You don't wait for someone else. You fix it.

**[TRANSITION: Dave at a town hall, listening to residents]**

When I first ran for city council, I made a promise: I'd never forget where I came from.

**[MONTAGE: Quick cuts of Dave's accomplishments]**
- 46 neighborhood officers walking beats
- New schools with updated technology
- Mental health crisis centers
- Town hall meetings packed with residents
- Community budget voting events

**DAVE (Direct to camera):**
I've proven what I can do. As councilmember, I:

Hired 46 neighborhood officers who know your name
Invested $55 million in our schools
Opened 18 mental health centers
Gave YOU control over $15 million in spending

**[B-ROLL: Residents voting, kids in schools, officers in communities]**

The current mayor? He promised 100 officers and hired 23. He promised "Education First" and cut $12 million from schools. He promised monthly town halls and held 4 all year.

**[DAVE direct to camera, outdoor location]**

I'm running for mayor because promises without action aren't leadership - they're betrayal.

**[MONTAGE: Diverse community members at various Dave events]**

This campaign is powered by people like you. No corporate PACs. No special interests. Just neighbors who believe we deserve better.

**[DAVE direct to camera, close-up]**

I'm Dave Biggers, and I'm asking for your vote - not because of what I promise to do, but because of what I've already done.

**Featured:** Officer James Chen + Diana Washington (mental health story)  

### SCRIPT:

**[OPEN: Officer walking neighborhood beat, early morning]**

**OFFICER CHEN (talking while walking):**
I'm Officer Chen. I've been a neighborhood officer for 3 years, thanks to Dave's program.

**[He waves to residents, who wave back]**

I know every family on this beat. Mrs. Rodriguez - her son just graduated high school. The Thompsons - they're expecting their second baby. Carlos runs the bodega on the corner.

**[B-ROLL: Officer helping elderly woman cross street, playing basketball with kids]**

That's the difference. Before this program, I responded to calls and left. Now? I'm part of the community.

**[STATISTICS appear as text overlays]**
- Response time: Down 35%
- Community trust: Up 62%
- Crime: Down 23%

**CUT TO: Diana Washington in her home**

**DIANA:**
Two years ago, my brother Michael had a mental health crisis.

**[B-ROLL: Photos of Michael (blurred for privacy), family photos]**

Old system? They would've sent police with guns. Maybe he gets arrested. Maybe worse.

**[Her voice cracks with emotion]**

But Dave's program sent trained mental health counselors. They de-escalated the situation. They got Michael to a facility that could help him.

**[Current photo of Michael, smiling, healthy]**

Michael is doing great now. He has a job. He's stable. Dave's program saved his life.

**[STATISTICS appear]**
- 847 mental health calls diverted from police
- 0 officer-involved shootings in mental health responses
- 94% of individuals connected to ongoing care

**CUT TO: Dave with both Officer Chen and Diana**

**DAVE:**
Public safety isn't just about more police. It's about smarter approaches. It's about preventing crime, not just responding to it. It's about mental health care, not handcuffs.

**[B-ROLL montage:]**
- Mental health professionals responding to calls
- Neighborhood officers building relationships
- Community safety programs
- Youth intervention programs

**DAVE (direct to camera):**
The mayor promised 100 officers. He hired 23. I promised a comprehensive approach. I delivered 46 neighborhood officers AND 18 mental health centers.

That's the difference between promises and results.

Three years ago, I was getting C's and D's. I thought college wasn't for me.

**[B-ROLL: Empty after-school hallways, beat-up textbooks]**

Our school didn't have much. Old textbooks. No computers. No after-school programs.

**[TRANSITION: Patricia Rodriguez (Maria's mom) in classroom]**

**PATRICIA:**
I teach at Riverside Middle School. When Dave was elected to council, our schools were falling apart.

**[Photos of: deteriorating school buildings, outdated materials]**

The previous administration called education "a budget challenge." Dave called it a moral imperative.

Dave invested $55 million. Not just talk - actual money.

**[MONTAGE:]**

**[B-ROLL: Tutors working with students, students eating together, study groups]**

Within one semester, I went from C's to A's.

**[Maria shows acceptance letters]**

I got into three colleges. I'm going to State University in the fall. First person in my family to go to college.

**[Emotional moment with Patricia]**

That's what $55 million looks like. Not numbers on a spreadsheet. Lives changed.

- Graduation rate: 94% (all-time high)
- After-school programs: 2,400 students served

The current mayor cut $12 million from education. I invested $55 million.

**[Maria speaking directly to camera]**

**MARIA:**
If it wasn't for Dave's program, I wouldn't be heading to college. Vote for Dave - he invests in students like me.
