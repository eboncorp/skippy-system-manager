## THE CHOICE LOUISVILLE FACES

**Mayor Greenberg's Louisville:**
- Spends $59M on bureaucracy while neighborhoods struggle
- Puts police in patrol cars, reacting to 911 calls
- Makes decisions behind closed doors
- Treats symptoms after problems explode

**Dave Biggers' Louisville:**
- Invests $100M in [**democratic governance**](/glossary/democratic-governance/) and community power
- Puts 46 [**mini substations**](/glossary/mini-substation/) in neighborhoods with officers on foot
- Gives YOU a vote on $1.5M in neighborhood spending through [**participatory budgeting**](/glossary/participatory-budgeting/)
- Prevents problems before they start with [**prevention-first policing**](/glossary/prevention-first-policing/)

**The cost? Exactly the same: $898.8 million.**

The difference? Where every dollar goes.

---

## THE THREE PILLARS

### 1. PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGH PREVENTION
**Budget: $379.7M** (42.2% of total)

**The Problem:** Louisville has tried the same approach for decades - more police cars, more arrests, more reaction. Crime keeps rising because we're not addressing [**root causes**](/glossary/root-causes/).

**The Solution:** A [**prevention-first model**](/glossary/prevention-first-policing/) that stops crime before it happens.

**What You'll See:**

**46 [Mini Substations](/glossary/mini-substation/)** - One in EVERY Louisville Metro zip code by Year 4
- Officers on [**foot and bike patrols**](/glossary/community-policing/) 24/7
- Visible, accessible, embedded in YOUR neighborhood
- Community meeting spaces
- Not a fortress - a neighbor
- Imagine: one in Clifton, one in Shively, one in Okolona, one in Highlands, one in Portland, one in the West End - strategically placed to serve all neighborhoods across all six districts
- $8M investment ([**capital expenditure**](/glossary/capital-expenditure/))

**7 [Community Detectives](/glossary/community-detective/)** - One per district
- Focus on PREVENTING crime, not just solving it
- Build relationships before incidents occur
- Partner with schools, churches, community centers
- Know your neighborhood by name
- $1.4M investment ([**operating expense**](/glossary/operating-expense/))

**18 [Community Wellness Centers](/glossary/community-wellness-center/)** - 3 per district
- Primary healthcare (nurse practitioners)
- Mental health and [**substance abuse treatment**](/glossary/substance-abuse-treatment/)
- [**Social services hub**](/glossary/social-services-coordination/) (housing, food, benefits)
- Address the [**ROOT CAUSES**](/glossary/root-causes/) of crime
- Real locations in real neighborhoods - Old Louisville, Russell, Newburg, PRP, Germantown, and beyond
- $27M investment (NEW program)

**15 Fire Prevention Centers**
- Teach fire safety BEFORE disasters
- Home inspections for seniors
- Smoke detector programs
- Youth education
- $12M investment (NEW program)

**[Mental Health Crisis Response](/glossary/mental-health-crisis-response/)**
- Social workers paired with police
- Mobile crisis units
- Proper response to mental health calls
- $3.5M investment (expanded)

**[Youth Violence Prevention](/glossary/youth-violence-prevention/)**
- $35M consolidated investment (up from $15M scattered)
- After-school programs 3pm-7pm (peak crime hours)
- 2,000 summer jobs for teens
- Mentoring and [**family support services**](/glossary/family-support-services/)
- [**Community violence interruption**](/glossary/violence-interruption/)

**Traffic Safety & [Codes Enforcement](/glossary/codes-enforcement/)**
- School zone safety with automated cameras: $3M
- Codes as public safety (preventing dangerous buildings): $10M
- Because prevention applies to ALL hazards

**The Promise:** 35% reduction in crime in 4 years

**The Evidence:** Similar prevention-first approaches have worked in other cities:
- Boston: 63% reduction in youth homicides through Operation Ceasefire (1996-2000)
- Los Angeles: 18% reduction in violent crime in GRYD program zones (2011-2018)
- Newark: 35% reduction in shooting victims (55% reduction in homicides) through community partnerships (2013-2022)

**The Reality:** We're spending SMARTER, not just MORE. By reallocating $11.6M in police [**administrative overhead**](/glossary/administrative-overhead/) to mini substations and [**community policing**](/glossary/community-policing/), we get better results for less money.

---

### 2. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY & EFFICIENCY
**Budget: $100M** (11.1% of total)

**The Problem:** Decisions made behind closed doors. Budgets that are 200+ pages of incomprehensible numbers. Citizens shut out of their own government.

- Building permits, inspection results public
- Economic development agreements fully disclosed
- Louisville becomes one of nation's most transparent cities

**Administrative Efficiency** - Cut the Waste

- Consolidate 47 duplicative positions
- Move managers back to frontline work
- Invest savings in services YOU see
- Not layoffs - [**attrition and reassignment**](/glossary/workforce-transition/)

**The Promise:** Louisville in top 10 nationwide for government transparency

**The Evidence:**
- Participatory budgeting in Boston: 90% of participants satisfied with process and outcomes
- NYC's $40M annual participatory budgeting program: 55,000 voters participate, with highest engagement in lower-income districts

## YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### "Can we really afford this?"
Yes, because we're not spending more - we're spending smarter. Every new program is funded by cutting waste and reallocating from bureaucracy to services.

### "Won't cutting administration hurt services?"
No, because we're not cutting workers - we're cutting [**management overhead**](/glossary/administrative-overhead/). Those 47 positions are consolidated through [**attrition**](/glossary/workforce-transition/) (retirement, resignation) and reassignment to frontline work.

### "Has this worked anywhere else?"
Yes, extensively. Every program cites evidence from cities nationwide. See Research Bibliography at rundaverun.org/research

### "How do I get involved?"
- Volunteer: rundaverun.org/volunteer
- Donate: rundaverun.org/donate
- Learn more: rundaverun.org/policy

### "Will this really reduce crime?"
Evidence says yes. Cities with prevention-first approaches see 18-35% reductions. We're being conservative with our 35% goal over 4 years.

### "What if programs don't work?"
Every program has [**performance metrics**](/glossary/performance-metrics/). Programs that don't deliver results get defunded. Your tax dollars will be protected by [**data-driven accountability**](/glossary/evidence-based-policy/).

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Louisville has a choice:**

**Continue the current approach:**
- React to problems after they explode
- Spend on bureaucracy instead of neighborhoods
- Make decisions behind closed doors
- Hope for different results

**Or choose a new direction:**
- Prevent problems before they start
- Invest in communities
- Give citizens real power
- Demand accountability

**The cost is exactly the same: $898.8 million.**

**The difference is where every dollar goes.**
