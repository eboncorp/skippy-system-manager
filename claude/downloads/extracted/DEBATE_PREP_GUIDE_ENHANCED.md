## OPENING STATEMENT (2 minutes)

**The Hook:**
"Louisville faces a choice: Keep doing what hasn't worked, or adopt what's proven to work in 50+ American cities."

**The Problem:**
"For years, we've had the same approach to public safety: Two distant precincts, officers in cars driving past, 20+ minute response times. It's not working. Crime rates show it. Community trust shows it. We need a different approach."

**The Solution:**
"I'm offering a detailed, evidence-based plan using Louisville's existing $1.025 billion budget—zero tax increase—to transform how we approach public safety:

**46 mini police substations** throughout Louisville where officers work on foot, know your name, respond in 2 minutes instead of 20+. This has reduced crime 35-63% in Chicago, New York, LA, and 50+ cities.

**18 wellness centers** providing mental health and addiction treatment where people need it—preventing crime at the root rather than just responding after it happens.

**$35 million in youth programs**—triple our current investment—giving kids safe options instead of dangerous ones.

And **participatory budgeting**—$1 million per district where YOU vote on priorities, not bureaucrats behind closed doors."

**The Accountability:**
"Unlike typical campaign promises, every dollar is accounted for in an 831-line budget published online at rundaverun.org. Once elected, everything's tracked in real-time. Quarterly public reports. Independent evaluation. You can verify everything—and vote us out if we don't deliver."

**The Choice:**
"Same $1.025 billion budget. Two completely different approaches. One's proven to work. One hasn't. You decide."

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT (2 minutes)

**Callback to Opening:**
"At the start, I said Louisville faces a choice. Now you've heard the details."

**Summarize Contrast:**
"My opponent offers [their approach]—which is essentially what we've been doing. I'm offering a proven alternative backed by 30 years of research from 50+ cities.

The question isn't whether my plan is radical. It's not—it's the new standard in progressive American cities.

The question is: Why hasn't Louisville adopted it already?"

**Make It Personal:**
"If you live in West Louisville, my plan means a police substation within 5 minutes of your home, officers who know your name, and a wellness center offering mental health services.

If you're a parent, it means after-school programs keeping your kids safe and summer jobs teaching them skills.

If you're a senior, it means fire prevention programs addressing why seniors die in fires at 5x the rate.

If you're anyone in Louisville, it means YOU get to vote on how $1 million gets spent in YOUR district."

**The Accountability Closer:**
"I've published 831 lines of budget detail. My opponent can't or won't. I'm committing to real-time public tracking of every dollar. My opponent isn't. I'm establishing independent evaluation to verify results. My opponent isn't.

I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm giving you the tools to hold me accountable."

**The Call to Action:**
"Louisville deserves evidence-based governance, complete transparency, and real community power. That's what I'm offering. That's what you deserve. And that's what we'll deliver together.

Visit rundaverun.org to see the full plan. Thank you."

## KEY TOPICS & RESPONSES

### TOPIC: PUBLIC SAFETY & CRIME

**Your Position:**
"Transform public safety through proven community policing, mental health intervention, and youth prevention programs."

**Key Points:**
- 46 mini police substations for 2-minute response times
- Wellness centers for mental health/addiction at the root
- Youth programs preventing crime before it starts
- Evidence: 35-63% crime reduction in 50+ cities
- Same police budget, better deployment

**If Attacked on "Soft on Crime":**
"Let's be clear: Which is tougher on crime—officers in cars arriving 20+ minutes after a crime, or officers on foot in your neighborhood preventing crime before it happens? Chicago reduced crime 35% with mini substations. NYC reduced it 63%. That's not soft. That's smart."

**If Attacked on "Defunding Police":**
"That's false. We're reorganizing police to be MORE effective, not cutting them. Every current officer keeps their job. We're cutting administrative bureaucrats, not street cops. And we're improving officer working conditions: neighborhood assignments where they build relationships instead of just responding to crises."

### TOPIC: BUDGET & TAXES

**Your Position:**
"Same $1.025 billion budget Louisville already has. Zero tax increase. Just better priorities."

**Key Points:**
- Total budget: $1.025B (exactly same as current)
- Cut $16M in bureaucracy (Mayor's office + LMPD admin)
- Redirect to neighborhoods, not bureaucrats
- Every dollar tracked in real-time
- 831-line budget published online

**If Attacked on "Can't Afford It":**
"We're using the exact same budget Louisville already has—$1.025 billion. Not a penny more. The question isn't 'can we afford this?' The question is: Can we afford to keep wasting $1.025 billion on approaches that aren't working? I've shown exactly where every dollar comes from and goes. Can my opponent say the same?"

**If Attacked on "Budget Math Doesn't Work":**
"It absolutely works, and you can verify it yourself. Go to rundaverun.org/budget—831 lines of detail. Every program, every cost, every position. Independent fiscal experts have reviewed it. The math works. Has my opponent published their budget with this level of detail? No. Who's more transparent?"

### TOPIC: ACCOUNTABILITY & TRANSPARENCY

**Your Position:**
"More accountability than Louisville has ever had: Real-time tracking, independent evaluation, community oversight."

**Key Points:**
- Real-time public dashboard tracking every dollar
- Quarterly reports on crime, response times, satisfaction
- Independent university evaluation
- Community district councils overseeing monthly
- Can vote us out if we don't deliver

**Your Advantage:**
"I've published 831 lines of budget detail online. My opponent hasn't. I'm committing to real-time public tracking. My opponent isn't. I'm establishing independent evaluation. My opponent isn't. Who's more accountable?"

### TOPIC: IMPLEMENTATION & TIMELINE

**Your Position:**
"Detailed 4-year implementation plan with specific, measurable milestones."

**Key Points:**
- Year 1: 10 substations in highest-crime areas
- Year 2: 20 substations (43%), early results showing
- Year 3: 36 substations (78%), Louisville cited nationally
- Year 4: All 46 complete, 40-50% crime reduction
- Every milestone tracked and published

**Your Advantage:**
"I have specific implementation plans for Day 1. Sites identified. Partnerships drafted. Timeline published. My opponent has vague promises. I have detailed plans. There's a difference."

### TOPIC: EVIDENCE & RESEARCH

**Your Position:**
"Every policy backed by research from 50+ cities and academic studies."

**Key Points:**
- Mini substations: Chicago, NYC, LA, Boston, 50+ cities
- Wellness centers: San Francisco, Portland, Austin, Denver
- Youth programs: Boston, Chicago, Oakland proven models
- Participatory budgeting: 7,000+ cities on 6 continents
- 30+ years of academic research

**Your Advantage:**
"I can name specific cities, specific programs, specific results. My opponent offers rhetoric. I offer evidence. Louisville deserves evidence-based governance, not political talking points."

### TOPIC: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

**Your Position:**
"Real community power through participatory budgeting and transparency."

**Key Points:**
- $6M annually ($1M per district) decided by residents
- Community meetings + online voting
- YOU decide priorities, not bureaucrats
- Used in 7,000+ cities worldwide
- Increases civic engagement 50%

**Your Advantage:**
"My plan gives YOU direct power over spending. My opponent's plan gives bureaucrats power. Which do you prefer?"

## HANDLING SPECIFIC ATTACKS

### ATTACK: "Too Expensive"
**Response:** "False. Same $1.025B budget. Zero tax increase. I've published 831 lines showing exactly where every dollar comes from and goes. Can my opponent say the same?"

### ATTACK: "Soft on Crime"
**Response:** "Officers on foot in your neighborhood, 2-minute response times—that's TOUGHER on crime than cars driving past. Ask Chicago, which reduced crime 35%. Ask NYC, which reduced it 63%. Evidence matters."

### ATTACK: "Untested/Experimental"
**Response:** "Used in 50+ cities. Studied for 30 years. Recommended by National Institute of Justice. Chicago, New York, LA, Boston, Philadelphia—all using these approaches. What's actually untested is hoping the same failed approach will somehow work next year."

### ATTACK: "Will Eliminate Police Jobs"
**Response:** "Zero officers fired. 100% job protection. We're cutting ADMINISTRATORS, not street cops. Every current officer keeps their job and gets better working conditions. Cities using this model see BETTER officer retention."

### ATTACK: "Budget Math Doesn't Work"
**Response:** "It works. rundaverun.org/budget—831 lines. Independent experts reviewed it. You can verify it yourself. Has my opponent published their budget at this detail level? No. Who's more trustworthy?"

### ATTACK: "Just Politics/All Talk"
**Response:** "I've published 831 lines of budget detail, 4-year implementation timeline, specific sites, partnership agreements. That's not talk—that's governance. My opponent has vague promises. I have detailed plans. There's a difference."

---

## DEBATE TACTICS

## QUESTION TYPES & STRATEGIES

### POLICY QUESTIONS
**Strategy:** Details + Evidence + Louisville Context
**Example:** "How will you address crime?"
**Response:** "46 mini police substations throughout Louisville where officers work on foot. This reduced crime 35-63% in Chicago, New York, and 50+ cities. Year 1, we deploy 10 in highest-crime areas. By Year 4, every zip code covered. Cost: $650K to build each, $200K annually to operate, funded by cutting $16M in bureaucracy."

### ATTACK QUESTIONS
**Strategy:** Facts + Redirect + Contrast
**Example:** "Your opponent says you want to defund police."
**Response:** "That's false. We're deploying MORE police through 46 substations—one in every zip code. Officers on foot, 2-minute response times. That's tougher on crime, not softer. Every current officer keeps their job. We're cutting administrative bureaucrats, not street cops. Chicago reduced crime 35% with this approach. The question is: Why hasn't Louisville adopted proven methods?"

### "GOTCHA" QUESTIONS
**Strategy:** Acknowledge + Bridge + Message
**Example:** "Do you think Louisville police are racist?"
**Response:** "I think Louisville police officers do difficult, dangerous work every day, and most do it with integrity. I also think our SYSTEM hasn't given them the tools to succeed—they're spread too thin across 2 huge precincts, responding to mental health calls they're not trained for, working in communities where relationships are strained. My plan IMPROVES their working conditions while improving community safety. That's better for everyone."

### HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS
**Strategy:** Real-World Examples + Your Plan
**Example:** "What if your plan doesn't reduce crime?"
**Response:** "Good question. That's why I've built in real-time tracking, quarterly reports, and independent evaluation. But let's be clear: This isn't hypothetical. Chicago DID reduce crime 35%. NYC DID reduce crime 63%. This approach HAS worked in 50+ cities. Louisville won't be different. And if somehow we don't hit targets, the data will show why and we'll adjust—that's evidence-based governance. Plus, you can vote us out."

### PERSONAL QUESTIONS
**Strategy:** Brief Personal + Quick Pivot to Policy
**Example:** "Why are you qualified to be mayor?"
**Response:** "I've spent years researching what actually works in public safety—studying 50+ cities, consulting with police chiefs, reviewing academic research. But the real qualification isn't my background—it's my plan. 831 lines of budget detail. Evidence-based policies. Complete transparency. Louisville needs governance, not politics. That's what I'm offering."

## QUESTION & ANSWER STRUCTURE

### The Formula: **ANSWER - EVIDENCE - LOUISVILLE**

**Question:** "How will you reduce crime?"

**ANSWER:** "46 mini police substations where officers work on foot in neighborhoods."

**EVIDENCE:** "This reduced crime 35% in Chicago, 63% in NYC, and is used in 50+ American cities."

**LOUISVILLE:** "Year 1, we deploy 10 in West Louisville and other high-crime areas. By Year 4, every zip code covered. Cost: $30M over 4 years, funded by cutting administrative bloat."

---

## COMMON MODERATOR QUESTIONS

### 1. "What makes you qualified to be mayor?"
**Answer:** "I've done the research on what actually works—50+ cities, academic studies, consultations with chiefs who've implemented these approaches. But qualifications aren't just resume—they're plans. I've published 831 lines of budget detail. Every policy backed by evidence. Complete transparency. Louisville needs governance, not politics."

### 2. "What's your top priority?"
**Answer:** "Public safety transformation. Not because it's the only issue, but because safe communities are the foundation for everything else—economic development, education, quality of life. And we have proven solutions: 46 mini police substations, wellness centers, youth programs. Same budget, zero tax increase, 35-63% crime reduction in 50+ cities."

### 3. "How will you work with opponents/Metro Council?"
**Answer:** "With facts and transparency. I've published my entire budget online—831 lines. Council members can verify every number. I'm committing to quarterly reports and real-time tracking. When decisions are based on evidence rather than politics, cooperation becomes easier. And frankly, these approaches have bipartisan support nationally—they work regardless of party."

### 4. "What would you do differently from the current mayor?"
**Answer:** "Three things: Complete transparency—831-line budget online, real-time tracking. Evidence-based policies—adopting what works in 50+ cities, not political rhetoric. Community power—participatory budgeting giving residents direct control over $6M annually. Same budget, fundamentally different approach."

### 5. "How will you address [specific neighborhood] concerns?"
**Answer:** "Specifically: [Name neighborhood] will get [specific benefit from your plan]. But more broadly, my plan ensures every neighborhood benefits: mini substations in every zip code, wellness centers distributed citywide, youth programs where they're needed most, and participatory budgeting so [neighborhood] residents decide their own priorities."
