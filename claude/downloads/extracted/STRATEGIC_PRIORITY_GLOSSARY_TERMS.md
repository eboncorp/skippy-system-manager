## THE TOP 50 (By Category)

### ACCOUNTABILITY & TRANSPARENCY (10 terms)

#### 1. Inspector General

**Definition:** An independent office that investigates fraud, waste, abuse, and misconduct in government operations. Reports directly to legislative body (Metro Council) rather than mayor.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville does NOT have an Inspector General.** This is a critical accountability gap. Most cities Louisville's size have IGs who:
- Investigate complaints about government operations
- Conduct performance audits
- Review contracts for waste and fraud
- Protect whistleblowers
- Issue public reports

**Dave's Proposal:** Create Inspector General Office
- **Budget:** $3.5M annually (included in $1.2B budget)
- **Staff:** 15-20 investigators and auditors
- **Powers:** Subpoena authority, access to all government records
- **Reports to:** Metro Council (not mayor)
- **Prevents:** Another PowerHouse-style deal

**Why This Matters:** Without an IG, Louisville has no independent watchdog. The mayor's office investigates itself. Department directors answer only to the mayor. Contractors know there's no real oversight. An IG would save millions by preventing waste and would catch problems before they become scandals.

**Talking Points:**
- "Louisville is one of the few major cities without an Inspector General"
- "We need a watchdog that answers to you, not the mayor"
- "An IG would have caught PowerHouse problems before it was too late"
- "$3.5M investment could save $20-30M in prevented waste"

**Related Terms:** Accountability, Oversight, Transparency, Whistleblower Protection, Performance Audit

---

#### 2. Clawback Provisions

**Definition:** Contract clauses that require companies to return taxpayer money if they fail to meet promised job creation, wage levels, or other commitments. Essential accountability tool for economic development deals.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville rarely uses clawback provisions.** When economic development deals fail to deliver:
- Companies keep the tax breaks
- Taxpayers lose twice (paid for incentives, didn't get promised jobs)
- No consequences for broken promises

**PowerHouse Example:**
- Promised 50 full-time jobs
- Got 25-year tax abatement worth $75M+
- **Zero clawback provisions**
- If they fail to create jobs, they keep the tax break

**Dave's Policy:** Require Clawbacks in ALL Economic Development Deals
- **Job creation:** Return funds if targets not met
- **Wage standards:** Clawback if paying below living wage
- **Local hiring:** Penalties if not hiring Louisville residents
- **Environmental compliance:** Return funds if violating permits

**Why This Matters:** Taxpayers invest billions in economic development incentives. Without clawbacks, companies have no incentive to keep promises. Clawbacks aren't anti-business - they're pro-accountability. Legitimate businesses welcome them because they level the playing field against companies that over-promise.

**Talking Points:**
- "If a company keeps its promises, clawbacks cost nothing"
- "PowerHouse has zero clawbacks - wrong with that picture?"
- "Your mortgage has penalties if you don't pay - why shouldn't incentive contracts?"
- "Every major deal should require: create jobs or return the money"

**Related Terms:** Economic Development Accountability, Community Benefits Agreement, Tax Increment Financing, PILOT, Corporate Accountability

---

#### 3. Community Benefits Agreement (CBA)

**Definition:** A legally binding contract between developers and community organizations requiring specific community benefits in exchange for project support. Can include local hiring, affordable housing, environmental protections, and public space.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville rarely requires CBAs.** Developers get public subsidies without guaranteeing community benefits:

**PowerHouse (No CBA):**
- $75M+ in tax abatements
- No local hiring requirements
- No wage standards
- No community benefits
- No environmental guarantees beyond legal minimums

**What PowerHouse CBA Should Have Required:**
- 25% local hiring
- $20/hour minimum wage
- Apprenticeship programs
- Environmental monitoring fund
- Community oversight committee
- Renewable energy commitments

**Dave's Policy:** Require CBAs for Projects Receiving Public Subsidies
- **Threshold:** Any project getting more than $1M in public benefits
- **Required elements:** Local hiring, wage standards, environmental protections
- **Community voice:** Affected neighborhoods negotiate benefits
- **Enforcement:** Clawback provisions if benefits not delivered

**Why This Matters:** Public subsidies should deliver public benefits. CBAs ensure communities gain from development, not just developers. They're especially critical in historically disinvested neighborhoods where development often brings displacement without benefit.

**Talking Points:**
- "Public money should require public benefits"
- "Louisville gives away millions with no strings attached"
- "CBAs are standard in cities like Boston, L.A., and Atlanta"
- "PowerHouse got $75M+ with zero community benefit requirements"

**Related Terms:** Economic Development Accountability, Clawback Provisions, Local Hiring, Living Wage, Community Engagement

---

#### 4. Open Data Platform

**Definition:** A government website that makes data publicly accessible in machine-readable formats. Allows residents, journalists, and researchers to analyze government operations.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville has minimal open data.** What's NOT available:
- Real-time budget spending
- Contract details
- Performance metrics
- Citation and enforcement data
- Detailed crime statistics
- Development project pipelines

**Best Practice Cities:**
- Chicago: ChicagoData portal with 1,000+ datasets
- New York: NYC Open Data with 2,500+ datasets
- Louisville: A few dozen outdated datasets

**Dave's Proposal:** Comprehensive Open Data Platform
- **Budget:** $500K setup, $200K annually to maintain
- **Features:**
  - Real-time budget tracking
  - All contracts over $10K
  - Performance metrics by department
  - Crime statistics (anonymized)
  - Development project tracking
  - Service request data
  - Code enforcement actions
- **API access:** Allows journalists and researchers to analyze
- **Mobile-friendly:** Accessible on any device

**Why This Matters:** Sunlight is the best disinfectant. When government operations are transparent, waste and corruption get caught earlier. Open data enables accountability journalism and informed public participation.

**Talking Points:**
- "If you're paying for it, you deserve to see it"
- "Louisville hides data that cities like Chicago publish daily"
- "Can't have accountability without information"
- "Open data prevents another PowerHouse"

**Related Terms:** Transparency, Accountability, Data-Driven Governance, Performance Metrics, Public Access

---

#### 5. Performance Metrics

**Definition:** Measurable indicators used to evaluate how well government programs achieve their intended outcomes. Moves beyond "how much we spend" to "what results we get."

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville rarely tracks performance metrics.** Departments are judged on spending and activity, not outcomes:

**Current State:**
- Police department tracks arrests (activity) not crime reduction (outcome)
- Parks tracks facilities (inputs) not community health (outcome)
- Economic development tracks incentives spent (activity) not jobs created per dollar (outcome)

**Dave's Approach:** Outcome-Based Performance Metrics
**Public Safety:**
- Crime reduction rates (not just arrest numbers)
- Community trust surveys
- Response times by neighborhood
- Officer deployment efficiency

**Parks & Recreation:**
- Community health indicators
- Park usage rates
- Program participation
- Equity of access

**Economic Development:**
- Jobs created per incentive dollar
- Wage levels of created jobs
- Local hiring percentages
- Clawback recoveries

**Why This Matters:** You can't manage what you don't measure. Without performance metrics, government can spend billions without knowing if programs work. Metrics enable accountability and continuous improvement.

**Talking Points:**
- "Accountability requires measurement"
- "Are we getting results or just spending money?"
- "Every program should answer: does it work?"
- "Metrics help us double down on what works and fix what doesn't"

**Related Terms:** Evidence-Based Policy, Data-Driven Governance, Accountability, Return on Investment, Program Evaluation

---

#### 6. Whistleblower Protection

**Definition:** Legal safeguards protecting government employees who report waste, fraud, abuse, or violations of law. Prevents retaliation like firing, demotion, or harassment.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville has weak whistleblower protections.** Employees who report problems face:
- Termination or demotion
- Hostile work environment
- Damage to career prospects
- Limited legal recourse

**What Strong Protection Looks Like:**
- Can't fire whistleblowers
- Can't retaliate indirectly (bad assignments, demotions)
- Anonymous reporting mechanisms
- Independent investigation of retaliation claims
- Job restoration if retaliation proven
- Legal fees covered if lawsuit necessary

**Dave's Policy:** Strengthen Whistleblower Protection
- **Independent hotline:** Not controlled by mayor's office
- **Anonymous reporting:** Protected identity
- **Inspector General investigation:** Independent review
- **Anti-retaliation enforcement:** Swift action against violators
- **Public reporting:** Annual report on whistleblower cases

**Why This Matters:** Government employees see waste and wrongdoing first. If they can't report it safely, problems fester. Strong whistleblower protection is essential infrastructure for accountability.

**Talking Points:**
- "Employees who see waste shouldn't fear for their jobs"
- "Whistleblowers save taxpayers millions"
- "Retaliation against whistleblowers is retaliation against the public"
- "Strong protection would have revealed PowerHouse problems earlier"

**Related Terms:** Accountability, Inspector General, Transparency, Employee Rights, Government Ethics

---

#### 7. Public Records (Open Records)

**Definition:** Laws requiring government to provide access to non-confidential documents upon request. Kentucky has Open Records Act, but enforcement is weak.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville routinely delays or denies records requests:**
- Months-long delays for basic documents
- Excessive fees discourage requests
- Broad claims of exemptions
- No penalties for violations
- Appeals process is lengthy and expensive

**What Requesters Face:**
- Request for contract: 60-90 days wait
- Request for emails: Claims of exemption
- Request for meeting minutes: Excessive copy fees
- Appeal denials: Years in court

**Dave's Policy:** Strengthen Open Records Access
- **30-day maximum response:** With extensions only for legitimate reasons
- **Reasonable fees:** Can't use fees to discourage requests
- **Narrow exemptions:** Presume disclosure unless compelling reason
- **Online portal:** Submit and track requests digitally
- **Annual reporting:** How many requests, response times, denials

**Why This Matters:** Open records are democracy's infrastructure. When government hides documents, corruption thrives. Strong open records laws enable journalism, accountability, and public participation.

**Talking Points:**
- "Public records belong to the public"
- "Government work in secret, waste thrives in darkness"
- "Can't take months to produce records taxpayers own"
- "Strong open records would have revealed PowerHouse problems"

**Related Terms:** Transparency, Accountability, Public Access, Sunshine Laws, Government Information

---

#### 8. Conflict of Interest

**Definition:** When a public official's personal interests (financial, family, business) could improperly influence their official decisions. Strong ethics rules require disclosure and recusal.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville's conflict rules are weak:**
- Council members vote on projects benefiting donors
- Officials maintain business relationships with contractors
- Family members get government jobs or contracts
- Development interests appoint Planning Commission members

**Examples:**
- Council members voting on developments next to property they own
- Officials with real estate interests voting on zoning
- Department directors hiring relatives
- Contractors making campaign contributions then winning bids

**Dave's Policy:** Strengthen Conflict of Interest Rules
- **Automatic recusal:** Can't vote on matters where you have financial interest
- **Disclosure requirements:** Public reporting of financial interests
- **Family members:** Strict limits on relatives doing business with city
- **Revolving door:** Cooling-off period before officials can lobby former colleagues
- **Ethics Commission:** Stronger enforcement powers

**Why This Matters:** When officials' personal interests conflict with public interests, the public loses. Strong conflict rules protect against corruption and restore public trust.

**Talking Points:**
- "Public office is public trust, not personal profit opportunity"
- "Conflicts of interest explain why government doesn't work for us"
- "Shouldn't vote on projects that benefit you personally"
- "Louisville's ethics rules are weaker than most cities our size"

**Related Terms:** Government Ethics, Transparency, Accountability, Campaign Finance, Revolving Door

---

#### 9. Transparency

**Definition:** Making government operations, decisions, and information open and accessible to the public. Includes open meetings, public records access, and proactive disclosure.

**Louisville Context:** Louisville ranks below peer cities in transparency. What's hidden:
- Budget spending in real-time
- Contract negotiation processes
- Development deal details
- Performance data
- Meeting documents before meetings

**Dave's Comprehensive Transparency Agenda:**
1. **Open Data Platform:** All non-confidential data published
2. **Real-Time Budget Tracking:** See spending as it happens
3. **Livestream All Meetings:** Metro Council, Planning Commission, boards
4. **Advance Document Access:** Meeting materials online 7 days before meetings
5. **Plain-Language Summaries:** Complex documents translated for residents
6. **Multi-Language:** Key documents in Spanish, Burmese, Arabic
7. **Mobile-Friendly:** All information accessible on smartphones
8. **Public Calendar:** Mayor's schedule published (like federal officials)

**Why This Matters:** Transparency is the foundation of accountability. When government operates in darkness, waste and corruption thrive. Transparency alone doesn't ensure good government, but you can't have good government without it.

**Talking Points:**
- "Sunlight is the best disinfectant"
- "If you're paying for it, you deserve to see it"
- "Louisville hides information that other cities publish daily"
- "Can't have accountability without transparency"

**Related Terms:** Open Data, Public Records, Accountability, Sunshine Laws, Open Meetings

---

#### 10. Evidence-Based Policy

**Definition:** Making government decisions based on rigorous evidence of what works rather than ideology, politics, or tradition. Uses research, data, and evaluation to guide choices.

**Louisville Context:** **Louisville often makes decisions without evidence:**
- Economic development deals approved with no analysis of effectiveness
- Programs continue year after year with no evaluation
- "We've always done it this way" justifies continuation
- Political considerations override evidence

**PowerHouse Example:**
- No evidence that massive tax abatements create jobs
- Research shows small businesses create more jobs per dollar
- Louisville ignored evidence and approved deal anyway

**Dave's Approach:** Evidence-Based Decision Making
**Before Starting Programs:**
- Research: What works in peer cities?
- Analysis: What does the evidence say?
- Pilot testing: Try small-scale first

**After Implementation:**
- Track metrics: Is it working?
- Evaluate outcomes: Did we achieve goals?
- Adjust or end: Double down on success, end failures

**Examples:**
- **46 Mini Substations:** Based on evidence from 20+ cities showing crime reduction
- **18 Wellness Centers:** Based on evidence showing $1.80 return per $1 invested
- **Participatory Budgeting:** Based on evidence from 7,000+ cities worldwide

**Why This Matters:** Evidence-based policy means your tax dollars fund what works, not what feels good or benefits special interests. It's cheaper and more effective than guessing or following political whims.

**Talking Points:**
- "Let's try what works, not just what sounds good"
- "Evidence doesn't care about politics"
- "20 cities prove community policing reduces crime - let's copy success"
- "PowerHouse deal contradicted all evidence about job creation"

**Related Terms:** Data-Driven Governance, Performance Metrics, Program Evaluation, Best Practices, Research-Based

### ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT & ACCOUNTABILITY (10 terms)

#### 11. Tax Increment Financing (TIF)

**Definition:** A financing tool where increases in property tax revenue from a designated area are used to pay for infrastructure improvements in that area. In theory, the development pays for itself. In practice, often diverts tax revenue from schools and other services.

**Louisville Context:** Louisville has 30+ TIF districts diverting $100M+ in property taxes annually. Problems:
- Revenue diverted from schools, libraries, fire protection
- Benefits developers more than community
- Created for areas that would have developed anyway
- Extends for 20-30 years
- Limited accountability for how funds are spent

**How TIF Works:**
1. Designate "blighted" area
2. Freeze property tax baseline
3. As property values increase, growth goes to TIF fund
4. Use TIF funds for infrastructure in area
5. After 20-30 years, TIF expires and full taxes flow to schools/etc.

**The Problem:**
- Money that should go to schools goes to developers
- Often used in areas that would develop without TIF
- Difficult to determine if TIF actually caused development
- Benefits accrue to developers and property owners
- Costs borne by schools and other taxing districts

**Dave's TIF Reform:**
- **Genuine blight only:** Can't use in areas already developing
- **Community benefits required:** Local hiring, affordable housing
- **Shorter terms:** 15 years maximum, not 30
- **Annual reporting:** How TIF funds spent, outcomes achieved
- **School protection:** Ensure schools don't lose revenue

**Talking Points:**
- "TIF was supposed to help blighted areas, not subsidize luxury development"
- "Louisville has diverted $100M+ from schools to developers"
- "If area is already developing, TIF is just a giveaway"
- "Every TIF should require community benefits"

**Related Terms:** Economic Development Incentives, Property Tax, Development Subsidies, Accountability

#### 12. PILOT (Payment in Lieu of Taxes)

**Definition:** Tax abatement where government exempts property from property taxes for a period (typically 10-25 years) and company makes smaller "payments in lieu" of taxes. Used to attract or retain businesses.

**Louisville Context:** PowerHouse got 25-year PILOT worth $75M+:
- Normally would pay ~$3M annually in property taxes
- With PILOT, pays much less
- Full taxes don't start until 2050s
- Meanwhile, Louisville pays for infrastructure immediately

**How PILOT Works:**
- Company requests property tax abatement
- Louisville approves (often with minimal review)
- Property assessed normally but taxes abated
- Company makes smaller "payments in lieu"
- After abatement period, pays full taxes

**PowerHouse Math:**
- $5 billion investment
- Normal property taxes: ~$3M/year = $75M over 25 years
- PILOT reduces this dramatically
- Louisville pays for infrastructure upgrades immediately
- PowerHouse creates 50 jobs

**The Absurdity:**
- $75M tax break for 50 jobs = $1.5M per job
- Could hire 3,750 police officers for one year with $75M
- Could fund 18 wellness centers for 8+ years
- Could fix thousands of potholes

**Dave's PILOT Reform:**
- **Living wage requirement:** All jobs pay $20/hour minimum
- **Local hiring:** 25% of workforce from Louisville
- **Clawback provisions:** Return money if don't hit targets
- **Community benefits agreement:** Specific community gains required
- **Annual reporting:** Jobs created, wages paid, local hiring achieved

**Talking Points:**
- "PowerHouse: $1.5M in tax breaks per job created"
- "We could hire teachers, police, nurses instead"
- "Tax breaks should require good jobs, not poverty wages"
- "Every PILOT should have clawbacks and community benefits"

**Related Terms:** Tax Abatement, Economic Development Incentives, Property Tax, Accountability, PowerHouse

---

#### 13. Living Wage

**Definition:** The hourly wage needed for a worker to afford basic needs (housing, food, transportation, healthcare, childcare) without public assistance. Unlike minimum wage (legal floor), living wage is calculated based on actual cost of living.

**Louisville Context:** Louisville's living wage varies by household:
- **Single adult:** $16-18/hour
- **Single adult with one child:** $25-30/hour
- **Single parent with two children:** $30-35/hour

Kentucky minimum wage: $7.25/hour (federal minimum)
- Full-time at minimum wage: $15,080/year (before taxes)
- Federal poverty line for family of 3: $24,860
- Living wage for family of 3: $62,400+ ($30/hour)

**The Louisville Reality:**
- 40-50% of Louisville workers earn below living wage
- Forces choices between rent, food, healthcare
- Many need public assistance despite working full-time
- Taxpayers subsidize companies that pay poverty wages

**Dave's Living Wage Policy:**
- **All city employees:** $20/hour minimum (phased to $25/hour)
- **City contractors:** Must pay living wages to workers on city contracts
- **Economic development incentives:** Any company getting tax breaks must pay living wages
- **Annual adjustment:** Tied to local cost of living

**Employee Bill of Rights:**
- Year 1: 7% raises
- Years 2-4: 5% annually
- Compounds to 24% over 4 years
- Moves thousands of city workers toward living wage

**Why This Matters:**
When workers can't afford basics on their wages, everyone pays twice:
1. Through low prices/taxes that enable low wages
2. Through public assistance filling the gap

Living wage requirements ensure taxpayer investments create genuine opportunity, not subsidized poverty.

**Talking Points:**
- "Full-time work should mean you can afford basics"
- "Taxpayers shouldn't subsidize companies that pay poverty wages"
- "PowerHouse got $75M but doesn't have to pay living wages"
- "Living wage requirements are accountability, not anti-business"

**Related Terms:** Wage Standards, Employee Compensation, Benefits Cliff, Economic Justice, Poverty Wages
