# 🚨 GLOSSARY CLEANUP - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Original glossary v1.0 had major data quality problems  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Clean version v1.1 ready for production

---

## The Problem in Numbers

```
📊 ORIGINAL GLOSSARY (v1.0)
   Total entries: 263
   
   ✅ Legitimate terms: 91 (34.6%)
   ❌ Artifacts/junk: 172 (65.4%)
   
   Result: 2 out of every 3 entries were NOT actual glossary terms!
```

---

## What Went Wrong?

Your glossary was accidentally filled with artifacts from policy documents:

### Major Issues:
1. **171 section headers** scraped as terms
   - "What It Is:" (appeared 20 times!)
   - "Cost:", "Evidence:", "Total:", etc.
   - These are formatting labels, not terms

2. **42 data fragments** without context
   - "$15 million" - million of what?
   - "24/7 coverage" - coverage of what?
   - Numbers without definitions

3. **1 document metadata** 
   - "Updated: October 13, 2025" - not a term!

### Example of Bad Entry (Removed):
```
Term: "What It Is:"
Definition: "Mini police substations in neighborhoods"
```
☝️ This is NOT a glossary term—it's a section header!

### Example of Good Entry (Kept):
```
Term: "Community Policing"
Definition: "Philosophy where police and residents work together 
as partners to solve problems and prevent crime..."
```
☝️ This IS a proper glossary term with a clear definition.

## The Fix

✅ **Removed 172 artifacts**  
✅ **Kept 91 legitimate terms**  
✅ **Generated new clean files**  
✅ **Documented everything**

    // Display on your site
  });
```

**Option 2: Direct HTML**
