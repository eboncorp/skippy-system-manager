- **Removed:** 172 artifacts

## Problem Types Found

### 1. Section Headers Mistaken as Terms

#### ❌ REMOVED: "What It Is:"
This appeared **20 times** with different content each time. Example:
```
Name: What It Is:
Definition: Mini police substations in neighborhoods (not full police stations)
```
**Problem:** "What It Is:" is a section header from policy docs, not a glossary term. The actual term should be "Mini Police Substation" or similar.

#### ❌ REMOVED: "Cost:"
Appeared **6 times**:
```
Name: Cost:
Definition: $650,000 per station annually
```
**Problem:** This is a budget data point without context. Not a term definition.

#### ❌ REMOVED: "Evidence:"
Appeared **6 times**:
```
Name: Evidence:
Definition: 20-30% average crime reduction in 50+ cities using this model
```
**Problem:** This is supporting data/citation, not a glossary term.

---

### 2. Document Metadata

#### ❌ REMOVED: "Updated:"
```
Name: Updated:
Definition: October 13, 2025

---
```
**Problem:** This is clearly a document date stamp, not a glossary term.

---

### 3. Data Fragments Without Context

#### ❌ REMOVED: "Amount:"
```
Name: Amount:
Definition: $15 million across all districts
```
**Problem:** This is a number without explaining what it refers to.

#### ❌ REMOVED: "Total:"
```
Name: Total:
Definition: 46 substations across all Louisville zip codes
```
**Problem:** Total of what? No term being defined.

#### ❌ REMOVED: "Coverage:"
```
Name: Coverage:
Definition: 24/7 across all districts
```
**Problem:** Coverage of what? Missing the actual concept.

---

### 4. Process Labels

#### ❌ REMOVED: "Process:"
```
Name: Process:
Definition: Community meetings → Project proposals → Public vote → City implements winning projects
```
**Problem:** This describes a process for something, but doesn't define what term this relates to.

#### ❌ REMOVED: "How to Request:"
```
Name: How to Request:
Definition: [Instructions for requesting something]
```
**Problem:** This is instructional text, not a term definition.

## Examples of KEPT Terms (Legitimate)

### ✅ KEPT: Proper Budget Terms

**Appropriation**
```
Definition: Money officially allocated by Metro Council for a specific purpose. 
Once appropriated, departments can spend it. Think of it like Congress approving 
funding - it's the formal permission to spend taxpayer dollars.
```
**Why kept:** Clear term name, complete definition explaining the concept.

**Capital Budget**
```
Definition: Money spent on long-term assets like buildings, roads, and equipment 
that last multiple years. If it lasts longer than one year, it's usually "capital" 
spending. Building a mini substation is capital; paying the officers who work 
there is operating.
```
**Why kept:** Defines a specific concept with examples.

---

### ✅ KEPT: Criminal Justice Terms

**Community Policing**
```
Definition: Philosophy where police and residents work together as partners to 
solve problems and prevent crime. Not just responding to 911 calls, but building 
relationships and addressing root causes. Think beat cops who know the neighborhood.
```
**Why kept:** Clear concept with explanation and context.

**Qualified Immunity**
```
Definition: Legal doctrine that protects police (and other government officials) 
from lawsuits unless they violated "clearly established" constitutional rights. 
Controversial because it often shields officers from accountability even in 
questionable situations.
```
**Why kept:** Defines a specific legal concept.

---

### ✅ KEPT: Government Structure

**Metro Council**
```
Definition: Louisville's 26-member legislative body (our city council). Approves 
budgets, passes laws (ordinances), and provides oversight of the Mayor. Each 
member represents a district with about 30,000 people.
```
**Why kept:** Defines a specific government body with Louisville context.

## The Pattern

### Artifacts Follow This Pattern:
- Name ends with ":"
- Name is a generic label (Cost, Total, Evidence, What It Is, etc.)
- Definition is a data point or fragment without explaining the concept
- Often very short (< 30 characters)
- Looks like it was scraped from a table or policy document structure

### Legitimate Terms Follow This Pattern:
- Name is a specific concept/term (noun or noun phrase)
- Definition explains what the term means
- Provides context and examples
- Length is substantial (usually > 50 characters)
- Can stand alone as a glossary entry

## How to Avoid This in the Future

1. **Validation Rule:** Term names should NOT end with ":"
2. **Length Check:** Definitions should be > 30 characters minimum
3. **Context Check:** Definition should explain a concept, not just state data
4. **Manual Review:** Review any terms that look like section headers
5. **Source Separation:** Keep glossary terms separate from policy document content
