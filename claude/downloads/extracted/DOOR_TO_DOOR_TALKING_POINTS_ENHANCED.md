## THE 30-SECOND INTRO

**At the door:**

"Hi! I'm [Your Name], a volunteer with Dave Biggers' campaign for Mayor. Do you have a quick minute to talk about the election?

Dave's running on a plan to transform Louisville's approach to public safety—using what's proven to work in 50+ cities like Chicago and New York. Same $1.025 billion budget, zero tax increase, but completely different priorities.

Are you familiar with his plan for 46 mini police substations throughout Louisville?"

**[If yes, interested]:** Continue conversation  
**[If no, interested]:** Quick overview below  
**[If not interested]:** "No problem! Can I leave you some information?" [Leave literature and move on]

---

## THE 2-MINUTE OVERVIEW

"Dave's plan has four main parts, all using the same budget Louisville already has:

**1. Mini Police Substations (46 total)**  
Small neighborhood police offices where officers work on foot, know your name, respond in 2 minutes instead of 20+. Proven to reduce crime 35-63% in Chicago, NYC, LA.

**2. Wellness Centers (18 total)**  
Mental health and addiction treatment where people need it. Prevents crime at the root. Reduces ER visits 35%, saves money.

**3. Youth Programs ($35 million)**  
Triple current investment in after-school programs, summer jobs for 2,000 teens. Reduces youth violence 35%.

**4. You Decide ($1 million per district)**  
Participatory budgeting—YOU vote on how $1 million gets spent in YOUR neighborhood. Used in 7,000+ cities worldwide.

Same $1.025 billion budget. No tax increase. Just smarter priorities based on what actually works."

## COMMON VOTER QUESTIONS & RESPONSES

### Q: "How will you pay for this?"

**A:** "Great question! We're not raising taxes or asking for more money. Louisville's budget is $1.025 billion—we're using that same amount. We're cutting $16 million in bureaucracy—fewer deputy mayors, less administrative bloat—and redirecting it to neighborhoods. Every dollar is accounted for in our 831-line budget at rundaverun.org."

### Q: "Isn't this 'defunding the police'?"

**A:** "Actually the opposite. We're putting MORE police on the streets through 46 mini substations—one in every zip code. Officers on foot who know your name, 2-minute response instead of 20+ minutes. That's TOUGHER on crime. Chicago reduced crime 35% with this approach. NYC reduced it 63%. It works."

### Q: "Has this been tried anywhere else?"

**A:** "Yes! Over 50 American cities use this approach—Chicago, New York, LA, Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle. It's been studied for 30 years with consistent results: 35-63% crime reduction. This isn't experimental. It's proven."

### Q: "What about current police officers?"

**A:** "Every current officer keeps their job—100% job protection. We're cutting administrative positions, not street cops. And we're actually improving working conditions: officers get neighborhood assignments where they build relationships instead of just responding to calls. Cities using this see better officer retention."

### Q: "When will we see results?"

**A:** "Year 1: 10 substations in highest-crime areas, early results. Year 2: 20 substations, 15% crime reduction expected. Year 4: All 46 complete, 40-50% crime reduction. Everything tracked in real-time on a public dashboard so you can verify the progress yourself."

### Q: "Why should I trust you?"

**A:** "Don't trust me—verify! Our entire 831-line budget is published online. Once elected, every dollar will be tracked in real-time on a public dashboard. Quarterly reports on crime, response times, community satisfaction. Independent university evaluation. And you can vote us out if we don't deliver. That's more accountability than Louisville has ever had."

### Q: "I like the current mayor..."

**A:** "That's totally fine! I'm not asking you to dislike anyone. I'm just asking: Are you happy with the results? Crime rates, response times, community safety? Dave's offering a proven alternative based on what's worked in 50+ cities. You deserve to know there's a better option."

### Q: "I don't vote in local elections."

**A:** "I understand—but local government affects your daily life more than anything else. Police response times, street safety, parks, services—that's all decided by the mayor. Your vote actually matters MORE here than in national elections. Can I help you register or verify your registration?"

### Q: "I'm not sure who I'm voting for yet."

**A:** "Perfect! That's exactly why I'm here—to give you information. Can I leave you some material to review? And if you have questions later, here's how to reach the campaign. [Give literature and contact info]"

### Q: "What neighborhood do you live in?"

**A:** "I live in [Your Neighborhood]. I'm volunteering because I believe in this plan for Louisville. Whether you're in the West End, East End, South End, or Highlands—this plan serves every neighborhood with mini substations and wellness centers."

### Q: "This sounds too good to be true."

**A:** "I get that! That's why Dave published the entire 831-line budget online at rundaverun.org. Every cost, every program, every dollar accounted for. It's not magic—it's just better priorities. Chicago, New York, and 50+ cities prove this works. Louisville can join them."

## NEIGHBORHOOD-SPECIFIC TALKING POINTS

### West Louisville
"Dave's plan prioritizes the West End:
- First 10 mini substations include multiple West Louisville locations
- Wellness centers focusing on areas with highest need
- Youth programs targeting areas with limited after-school options
- Economic development follows safety—property values rise in areas with substations

This isn't just talk. Dave's plan lists specific West End zip codes for Year 1 implementation."

### East End
"Even low-crime areas benefit:
- Mini substations provide 2-minute response times for everyone
- Fire prevention centers (seniors in East End die in fires at higher rates)
- Wellness centers mean better mental health services nearby
- Participatory budgeting—YOU decide what your neighborhood needs

Everyone deserves excellent city services, not just those in crisis areas."

### Highlands/Crescent Hill
"Progressive, evidence-based approach:
- Using research from 50+ cities
- Participatory budgeting (pioneered in progressive cities worldwide)
- Mental health professionals instead of police for crises
- Environmental approach: officers on foot/bike, not cars
- Complete transparency with real-time data

This is what smart cities do."

### South End
"Working-class neighborhoods benefit most:
- Better police response (2 minutes vs. 20+)
- Youth programs for kids who need them
- Fire prevention (protecting your property)
- Participatory budgeting ($1M decided by South End residents)
- No tax increase on your already tight budget

Same money, better priorities for working families."

### Suburbs/Jefferson County
"Even if you're outside Louisville Metro:
- County services funded by occupational tax (0.75%)
- Better regional coordination on crime and public safety
- Safer city means safer region
- Economic benefits spread beyond city limits
- Louisville as national model benefits entire region

What's good for Louisville is good for Jefferson County."

## SAMPLE CONVERSATIONS

**Voter:** "Sure, what's this about?"

**You:** "Dave's running on a plan to transform public safety using what works in 50+ cities. Same budget, no tax increase. Main thing is 46 mini police substations—small neighborhood offices where officers work on foot."

**Voter:** "How's that different from now?"

**You:** "Right now we have 2 big precincts across the whole city. Officers in cars, 20+ minute response times. With mini substations, officers are ON your street, know your name, respond in 2 minutes. Chicago reduced crime 35% with this model."

**Voter:** "How do we pay for it?"

**You:** "Great question! We're using Louisville's existing $1.025 billion budget. We cut $16 million in bureaucracy—fewer deputy mayors, less admin bloat—and redirect it to neighborhoods. No tax increase."

**Voter:** "Hmm, interesting. Where can I learn more?"

**You:** "Everything's at rundaverun.org—the full 831-line budget is published there. Can I leave you this one-pager? [Hand literature] And can we count on your vote?"

**Voter:** "I'll check it out. Probably yes."

**You:** "Perfect! Would you like a yard sign?"

**Voter:** "Sure!"

**You:** "Great! I'll note that and someone will deliver one. Thanks for your time!"

### **Conversation 2: Skeptical but Listening**

**You:** "Hi! I'm Marcus, volunteering with Dave Biggers for Mayor. Do you have a quick minute?"

**Voter:** "I guess. What's he want to do?"

**You:** "Main thing: 46 mini police substations throughout Louisville—small neighborhood police offices with officers on foot. Proven to reduce crime 35-63% in Chicago, New York, LA, and 50+ cities."

**Voter:** "Sounds expensive. Where's the money coming from?"

**You:** "Same budget Louisville already has—$1.025 billion. No tax increase. We're just cutting bureaucracy and redirecting to neighborhoods."

**Voter:** "Yeah, politicians always say that. How do I know it's true?"

**You:** "Fair question! Dave published the entire 831-line budget online at rundaverun.org. You can see every dollar. And once elected, everything's tracked in real-time on a public dashboard. You can verify it yourself."

**Voter:** "Hmm. Has this actually worked anywhere?"

**You:** "Yes—Chicago, New York, LA, Boston, Philly, Seattle, and 40+ more cities. It's been studied for 30 years. This isn't experimental. It's proven."

Main things are 46 mini police substations, wellness centers for mental health, and YOU get to vote on how $1 million gets spent in your district."

**Voter:** "YOU vote on spending? How does that work?"

**You:** "It's called participatory budgeting—used in 7,000+ cities worldwide. The community meets, proposes projects like playground equipment or street lighting, then residents vote online for what they want. $1 million per district decided by residents, not bureaucrats."

**Voter:** "That's interesting. I've never heard of that."

**You:** "It's pretty cool! New York does $35 million this way, Chicago does it, Boston. It gives residents real power. Can I leave you some information? The website is rundaverun.org with all the details."
