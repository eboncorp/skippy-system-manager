## THE ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITY

### Areas of Overlap (Merge & Strengthen)

#### 1. Budget & Finance Terms
**Current Situation:**
- Budget Glossary: 80+ terms
- Voter Education Glossary: 30+ terms
- **Overlap:** ~25 terms appear in both (appropriation, fiscal year, general fund, etc.)

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- **Keep the best version of each term**
- Budget Glossary versions are more conversational and accessible
- Voter Education versions have more Louisville data and policy connections
- **Create hybrid definitions** combining both strengths

**Example - "Participatory Budgeting":**

*Current (Budget Glossary):* Brief mention, generic definition  
*New (Voter Education):* Full Louisville context, $15M proposal, international examples, "why it matters"  
*Enhanced Version:* Combine accessibility of budget glossary with depth of voter education version

#### 2. Government Structure Terms
**Current Situation:**
- Budget Glossary: 15 terms (Metro Council, ordinance, resolution, etc.)
- Voter Education Glossary: 35 terms (same plus legislative authority, veto, override, etc.)
- **Overlap:** ~10 terms

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- Voter Education glossary is more comprehensive here
- Keep all Voter Education terms
- Add Budget Glossary's conversational tone to technical terms

#### 3. Accountability & Transparency Terms
**Current Situation:**
- Budget Glossary: Limited coverage (transparency, open data)
- Voter Education Glossary: 40 comprehensive terms
- **Minimal overlap**

**Enhancement Strategy:**
- This is almost entirely new content from Voter Education glossary
- Directly supports your campaign's accountability platform
- Adds massive value to existing budget documents

## STRATEGIC ENHANCEMENTS BY CATEGORY

### Enhancement 1: Budget & Finance

**Current State:**
- Budget Glossary: Good basics, conversational
- Missing: Complex accountability terms, performance metrics, fiscal policy

**Add from Voter Education:**
- Clawback Provisions (missing from Louisville incentives)
- Performance-Based Budgeting (your proposal)
- Zero-Based Budgeting (alternative to incremental)
- Cost-Benefit Analysis (evidence-based governance)
- Equity Impact Assessment (required in your budget)
- Fiscal Impact Analysis (missing from Louisville process)

**New Terms to Create:**
- Budget Variance Reporting (real-time transparency)
- Budget Amendment Process (how changes happen)
- Supplemental Appropriation (mid-year adjustments)

**Louisville-Specific Data to Add:**
- Actual FY 2025-2026 budget: $1.2 billion
- Revenue sources breakdown
- Historical budget growth rates
- Comparison to peer cities
- Where Louisville ranks (transparency, accountability)

**Example Enhanced Term: "General Fund"**

**Before (Budget Glossary):**
> "The main operating budget that pays for day-to-day city services. This is the $1.2B we're discussing in this campaign."

**After (Enhanced):**
> **General Fund**
> 
> **Definition:** The main operating budget that pays for day-to-day city services like police, fire, parks, and roads. Called "general" because the revenue isn't restricted to specific purposes (unlike grant funds or special revenue funds).
> 
> **Louisville Context:** Louisville's FY 2025-2026 General Fund budget is **$1.2 billion**, the same total as Mayor Greenberg's current budget. The difference isn't the amount - it's the priorities and accountability mechanisms.
> 
> **Revenue Sources:**
> - Occupational Tax: $487M (41%)
> - Property Tax: $310M (26%)
> - Insurance Premium Tax: $178M (15%)
> - Other sources: $225M (18%)
> 
> **Where It Goes:**
> - Public Safety (LMPD, Fire, EMS): $395.2M (33%)
> - General Government: $185M (15%)
> - Public Works: $127M (11%)
> - Parks & Recreation: $82M (7%)
> - All other departments: $410.8M (34%)
> 
> **Why This Matters:** Understanding the General Fund means understanding the choices your government makes. Louisville has the same resources as other cities our size, but we've chosen reactive policing over prevention, centralized services over community-based support, and closed-door decision-making over participatory budgeting. Same money, different priorities - that's what this election is about.

- Reference "Community Policing" term
- Show "Constitutional Policing" commitment
- Point to increased public safety funding
- Explain "Crime Prevention" vs. reaction

**Attack: "You'll raise taxes"**
**Defense:**
- Reference "General Fund" showing same $1.2B
- "Budget-Neutral" term
- "Reallocation" vs. new revenue
- "Efficiency Gains" examples

**Glossary as Shield:**
Every attack can be countered with:
"Actually, if you look at [specific term] in our glossary, you'll see [evidence-based response]."

## CONCLUSION

### Why This Matters

**The Problem:**
Voters are disengaged from local politics because they don't understand it. Complex terminology, insider jargon, and deliberately obfuscated information keeps residents from participating in democracy.

**Your Solution:**
A comprehensive glossary that:
1. Makes governance accessible to everyone
2. Empowers voters to evaluate all candidates
3. Demonstrates your expertise and preparation
4. Provides ongoing value beyond the election
5. Differentiates from every other local campaign

**The Opportunity:**
You have already created 80+ budget terms and 400+ voter education terms. By merging and enhancing these resources, you create:

**The Louisville Governance Glossary**
- 519 comprehensive terms
- 14 major policy categories
- Louisville-specific data throughout
- Evidence-based research
- Connected to all 21 policy documents
- Accessible to all voters
- Free and openly available

**This becomes:**
- Your campaign's educational foundation
- A media resource
- A volunteer training tool
- A community asset
- Your legacy (win or lose)

**The Bigger Picture:**
This isn't just a glossary. It's a statement about what you value:
- Informed citizens over manipulated voters
- Education over persuasion
- Transparency over obfuscation
- Empowerment over control
- Democracy over politics-as-usual

**"A Mayor That Listens, A Government That Responds"** starts with helping residents understand what they're listening to and what they should respond to.

**This glossary does that.**

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Review this enhancement strategy**
2. **Decide on scope** (full 519 terms or phased approach?)
3. **Allocate budget** ($1,500-2,500 recommended)
4. **Assign team member** to lead implementation
5. **Set launch date** (recommend 4 weeks out)

### Questions to Answer

1. Full glossary now, or phase in categories over time?
2. Premium WordPress plugin ($89) or free version?
3. Hire designer or create graphics in-house?
4. Hard launch with press event, or soft rollout?
5. Term of the Week starting when?
