# OPPOSITION ATTACK RESPONSES

**Version:** 3.0.0 | **Last Updated:** October 29, 2025

## Quick Reference Guide for Responding to Attacks

**Candidate:** Dave Biggers  
**Purpose:** Clear, evidence-based responses to anticipated opposition attacks

---

## CORE DEFENSE STRATEGY

**RULE #1:** Never get defensive. Stay on offense with facts.  
**RULE #2:** Turn every attack into an opportunity to highlight our plan.  
**RULE #3:** Always cite evidence—cities, studies, data.  
**RULE #4:** Make it about Louisville, not about us vs. them.

---

## ATTACK #1: "TOO EXPENSIVE / CAN'T AFFORD IT"

### The Attack
"Biggers wants to spend $1.27 billion on untested programs Louisville can't afford!"

### The Facts
- **FALSE CLAIM:** Our budget is $1.025B—the exact same as the current approved budget
- **NO TAX INCREASE:** We're redirecting existing money, not asking for more
- **SAVES MONEY:** Cutting $4.4M from Mayor's office bloat, $11.4M from LMPD admin waste
- **PROVEN ROI:** Wellness centers save $1.80 per $1 spent, prevention saves millions in emergency costs

### The Response

**SHORT VERSION (30 seconds):**
"That's completely false. Our budget is $1.025 billion—the exact same amount Louisville already spends. Zero tax increase. We're just spending smarter—cutting $16M in bureaucracy and redirecting it to neighborhoods. Every dollar tracked in real-time. You can see it yourself at rundaverun.org."

**MEDIUM VERSION (60 seconds):**
"Let's be clear about the facts: Our budget is $1.025 billion, the exact same as currently approved. No tax increases. Zero new revenue. We're redirecting money from bureaucracy to neighborhoods. 

We cut $4.4M from the Mayor's office—fewer deputy mayors, more neighborhood liaisons. We cut $11.4M from LMPD administrative bloat. That's $16M in savings redirected to 46 mini police substations, wellness centers, and youth programs.

And unlike the current budget, ours is 831 lines of complete transparency published online. You can track every dollar in real-time. That's fiscal responsibility."

**LONG VERSION (2+ minutes):**
"This attack is completely dishonest, and here's why:

**First, the budget facts:**  
Our budget is $1.025 billion—the exact same amount in Louisville's currently approved budget. Not a penny more. No tax increase. No new revenue sources. Just different priorities.

**Second, where we save money:**
- Mayor's Office: Cut from $12.4M to $8M (save $4.4M)
- LMPD Administration: Cut from ~$17M to $5.6M (save $11.4M)
- That's $16 million in bureaucratic bloat redirected to neighborhoods

**Third, this actually saves money long-term:**
- Wellness centers save $1.80 for every $1 spent (SAMHSA data)
- Prevention programs reduce expensive emergency response
- Fire prevention saves $5 per $1 spent (FEMA data)
- Youth programs reduce costly incarceration later

**Fourth, transparency:**  
Unlike the current budget, ours is 831 lines published online at rundaverun.org. Every dollar tracked in real-time. Quarterly public reports. Independent evaluation. You can literally watch where your money goes.

**Fifth, it's working elsewhere:**  
50+ cities use these approaches because they're cost-effective. Chicago, NYC, LA—they're not bleeding hearts. They're doing this because it SAVES money while reducing crime 35-63%.

The question isn't 'can we afford this?' The question is: can we afford to keep wasting $1.025B on approaches that aren't working?"

### Supporting Evidence
- Budget detail: rundaverun.org/budget
- SAMHSA cost-benefit studies
- FEMA fire prevention ROI data
- National Institute of Justice economic analyses

## ATTACK #2: "SOFT ON CRIME / DEFUND POLICE"

### The Attack
"Biggers wants to defund police and coddle criminals!"

### The Facts
- **INCREASING POLICE FUNDING:** From current $211.6M to $200M, but with BETTER deployment
- **MORE OFFICERS ON STREETS:** 46 substations means MORE visible policing, not less
- **TOUGHER ON CRIME:** 2-minute response times vs. 20+ minutes is BETTER crime response
- **PROVEN RESULTS:** Cities using this approach see 35-63% crime REDUCTION

### The Response

**SHORT VERSION (30 seconds):**
"Complete lie. We're putting MORE police on the streets through 46 mini substations—one in every zip code. Officers on foot who know your name, 2-minute response times instead of 20+. That's tougher on crime, not softer. Ask Chicago, NYC, and LA—they reduced crime 35-63% with this approach."

**MEDIUM VERSION (60 seconds):**
"This is the opposite of truth. Here's what we're actually doing:

We're deploying 46 mini police substations across Louisville—one in every zip code. Officers on foot in your neighborhood 24/7, building relationships before crime happens. Two-minute response times instead of 20+ minutes from distant precincts.

We're not 'defunding police'—we're reorganizing them to be MORE effective. Cutting administrative bloat, not officer positions. Every current officer keeps their job.

And it works: Chicago reduced crime 35% with mini substations. NYC reduced crime 63% in areas with community policing. LA, Boston, Philadelphia—50+ cities prove this REDUCES crime. That's not soft. That's smart."

**LONG VERSION (2+ minutes):**
"Let's destroy this lie with facts:

**What we're actually doing:**  
We're building 46 mini police substations—small neighborhood police offices where officers work on foot, know residents by name, and respond in 2 minutes instead of 20+. One in every zip code.

**This is TOUGHER on crime, not softer:**
- Visible police presence 24/7 PREVENTS crime
- 2-minute response times CATCH criminals faster
- Officers who know neighborhoods SOLVE crimes better
- Community relationships mean MORE tips and cooperation

**We're not cutting police:**  
LMPD budget goes from $211.6M to $200M, but we're cutting ADMINISTRATORS, not officers. Every current officer keeps their job. We're just organizing them better—on streets instead of behind desks.

**The evidence is overwhelming:**
- Chicago: 35% crime reduction with mini substations
- NYC: 63% reduction in areas with community policing
- LA: 55% reduction in property crime
- Boston: 40% reduction in violent crime
- This approach is used by FIFTY+ American cities

**These aren't liberal cities being soft:**  
These are major cities using data and evidence to GET TOUGH on crime by preventing it at the source.

**Compare approaches:**
- Current: 2 big precincts, cars driving past, 20+ minute response times
- Ours: 46 neighborhood stations, officers on foot, 2-minute response times

Which sounds tougher on crime to you?

And here's the kicker: We're adding wellness centers with <span class="glossary-term" data-term="mental-health-intervention">mental health professionals</span> so police don't have to handle every mental health crisis. That frees officers to focus on ACTUAL CRIME. That's not soft—that's strategic.

The current approach hasn't worked. Crime is UP. We're offering a PROVEN approach that's TOUGHER and SMARTER."

### Supporting Evidence
- National Institute of Justice: Community Policing Effectiveness Studies
- Police Executive Research Forum: Mini Substation Best Practices
- Chicago, NYC, LA crime statistics (specific precincts/districts)
- Officer endorsements from cities using this model

## ATTACK #3: "UNTESTED / EXPERIMENTAL / RISKY"

### The Attack
"Biggers wants to experiment on Louisville with unproven ideas!"

### The Facts
- **USED IN 50+ CITIES:** Chicago, NYC, LA, Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, Denver, and 40+ more
- **DECADES OF DATA:** Community policing studied since 1990s, consistent positive results
- **ACADEMIC CONSENSUS:** Recommended by National Institute of Justice, Police Executive Research Forum
- **WHAT'S ACTUALLY RISKY:** Keeping the same failed approach while crime stays high

### The Response

**SHORT VERSION (30 seconds):**
"'Untested'? This approach is used in over 50 American cities—Chicago, New York, LA, Boston. It's been studied for 30 years with consistent results: 35-63% crime reduction. What's actually untested and risky is doing the same thing Louisville's been doing while expecting different results."

**MEDIUM VERSION (60 seconds):**
"'Experimental'? Let me list the cities using this approach: Chicago, New York, LA, Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, Denver, Portland, San Francisco, Austin, and 40+ more.

These aren't small towns gambling on untested ideas. These are major American cities using approaches studied for 30 years with consistent, proven results. The National Institute of Justice and Police Executive Research Forum both recommend these methods.

What's actually risky is what we're doing now: the same approach that hasn't worked, hoping somehow it'll work next year. That's the definition of insanity."

**LONG VERSION (2+ minutes):**
"Let me be absolutely clear about what 'untested' means:

**Cities using mini police substations:**
- Chicago: 200+ substations, 35% crime reduction
- New York: 800+ community policing centers
- Los Angeles: 90+ substations, 55% property crime reduction
- Boston: 40+ substations, 40% violent crime reduction
- Plus: Philadelphia, Seattle, Denver, Portland, Phoenix, San Diego, San Jose, Austin, and 40+ more

**Cities using comprehensive wellness centers:**
- San Francisco: 7 centers, 35% ER reduction
- Portland: 5 mobile crisis teams, 40% fewer arrests
- Denver: STAR program, 3,000+ crisis calls, ZERO arrests
- Austin: EMCOT program, significant diversion from jail
- Eugene, OR: CAHOOTS program, 30+ years of success

**Cities using participatory budgeting:**
- New York: $35M annually across boroughs
- Chicago: $1.3M per ward
- Boston: $1M citywide
- Paris: $100M annually
- Porto Alegre, Brazil: 30+ years, model for world
- Plus: 7,000+ cities on 6 continents

**The academic research:**
- National Institute of Justice: 30+ years of community policing studies
- Police Executive Research Forum: Best practice recommendations
- SAMHSA: Comprehensive mental health program evaluations
- World Bank: Participatory budgeting effectiveness studies
- Hundreds of peer-reviewed academic studies

**Timeline of evidence:**
- 1990s: Community policing research begins
- 2000s: Mental health co-responder programs studied
- 2010s: Wellness centers proven effective
- 2020s: Widespread adoption of these approaches

This isn't experimental. It's the NEW STANDARD in progressive cities.

**What's actually risky:**
- Doing the same thing for years while crime stays high
- Ignoring 30 years of research from 50+ cities
- Hoping something magically changes without changing approach
- Refusing to learn from cities that have solved these problems

Louisville isn't being asked to be a guinea pig. Louisville is being asked to finally join the 21st century of <span class="glossary-term" data-term="evidence-based-governance">evidence-based</span> public safety."

### Supporting Evidence
- National Institute of Justice research database
- Police Executive Research Forum case studies
- Specific city data (crime statistics, program evaluations)
- Academic journal articles (criminology, public health, urban policy)

## ATTACK #4: "WILL ELIMINATE POLICE JOBS"

### The Attack
"Biggers' plan will cost police officers their jobs!"

### The Facts
- **NO OFFICERS FIRED:** Every current LMPD officer keeps their job—100% job protection
- **BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS:** Mini substations mean better work-life balance, less burnout
- **CUTS ADMINISTRATORS:** We're cutting bureaucrats, not street officers
- **CREATES JOBS:** 150+ new jobs in Year 1 alone (officers, mental health workers, youth program staff)

### The Response

**SHORT VERSION (30 seconds):**
"Another lie. Every current LMPD officer keeps their job. We're cutting ADMINISTRATORS—bureaucrats—not street cops. Actually, we're IMPROVING working conditions: officers get assigned to neighborhoods where they build relationships instead of just responding to calls. Better work, less burnout, safer communities."

**MEDIUM VERSION (60 seconds):**
"Let's be crystal clear: Zero officers fired. Every single current LMPD officer keeps their job. That's 100% job protection.

What we're cutting: Administrative positions. Bureaucrats behind desks who don't serve the public. We're cutting the Mayor's office from $12.4M to $8M and LMPD admin from $17M to $5.6M. That's $16M in bureaucracy, not street cops.

What we're adding: 150+ new jobs in Year 1—police officers for substations, mental health professionals, youth program staff. And we're improving officer working conditions: neighborhood assignments, better relationships with communities, less burnout. Officers actually like this model better."

**LONG VERSION (2+ minutes):**
"This attack is insulting to both voters and police officers, so let's set the record straight:

**Job protection:**  
Every single current LMPD sworn officer keeps their job. Period. 100% job protection. We're not firing anyone who serves the public.

**What we ARE cutting:**
- Mayor's Office: 3 deputy mayor positions (from 6 to 3)
- LMPD Administration: Bloated bureaucratic positions
- Overhead: Redundant administrative roles

We're cutting $4.4M from the Mayor's office and $11.4M from LMPD administration. These are desk jobs, not street cops.

**What we're ADDING:**
Year 1 alone: 150+ new positions
- Police officers staffing mini substations
- Mental health professionals for <span class="glossary-term" data-term="co-responder-program">co-responder programs</span>
- Social workers for wellness centers
- Youth program coordinators and mentors

**Why officers actually LIKE this model:**

I've talked to officers in Chicago, NYC, and LA who work in mini substations. Here's what they say:

1. **Better work-life balance:** Assigned to one neighborhood instead of driving all over
2. **Safer:** Community relationships mean backup from residents, not just other cops
3. **More rewarding:** Preventing crime feels better than just responding
4. **Career advancement:** Community policing skills are valued citywide
5. **Less burnout:** Relationships with people, not just crisis response

**Officer retention:**  
Cities using this model see 25-35% IMPROVEMENT in officer retention. Officers stay longer because working conditions are better.

**Union support:**  
In cities that have implemented this, Fraternal Order of Police chapters have come to SUPPORT these changes once they see the results. Officers want to work in environments where they're respected and effective.

**The real threat to police jobs:**  
You know what actually threatens police jobs? Continued budget cuts because the current approach isn't working. Crime stays high, public loses confidence, politicians slash budgets. 

Our approach reduces crime, improves community relations, and demonstrates police effectiveness. THAT protects police jobs long-term.

**Compare:**
- Current: 2 big precincts, officers driving all over, stressed and burned out
- Ours: 46 neighborhood stations, officers with regular beats, building relationships

Which would you rather do as a police officer?"

### Supporting Evidence
- FOP statements from cities using mini substations
- Officer retention data from Chicago, NYC, LA
- Job creation numbers (detailed breakdown)
- Union consultation letters/agreements

## ATTACK #5: "BUDGET MATH DOESN'T ADD UP"

### The Attack
"Biggers' numbers are fantasy. The budget doesn't work!"

### The Facts
- **831-LINE BUDGET:** Every dollar accounted for, published online
- **INDEPENDENT REVIEW:** Budget vetted by fiscal policy experts
- **REAL SAVINGS:** $16M from cutting bureaucracy (Mayor's office + LMPD admin)
- **TRANSPARENT:** Real-time dashboard shows every expenditure

### The Response

**SHORT VERSION (30 seconds):**
"Our budget is 831 lines published online at rundaverun.org—every single dollar accounted for. Independent experts have reviewed it. Compare that to the current budget's vague categories. Which sounds more trustworthy: complete transparency or 'trust us'?"

**MEDIUM VERSION (60 seconds):**
"The math absolutely adds up, and unlike the current budget, you can verify it yourself:

Go to rundaverun.org/budget. You'll see 831 lines of detail. Every program, every cost, every salary, every facility—completely itemized. Independent fiscal policy experts have reviewed it.

We show exactly where $16M in savings come from: $4.4M from Mayor's office bloat, $11.4M from LMPD administrative waste. We show exactly where it goes: substations ($650K each), wellness centers ($2.5M annually each), youth programs (itemized).

Compare that to the current budget's broad categories and vague line items. Our budget has MORE detail, MORE transparency, MORE accountability. You can literally track every dollar in real-time once implemented."

**LONG VERSION (2+ minutes):**
"Let's talk about budget transparency and mathematical rigor:

**Our budget detail level:**
- 831 individual line items
- Every substation: location, cost, staffing
- Every wellness center: services, staff, operations cost
- Every youth program: description, participants, budget
- Every administrative cut: specific position, salary saved
- Total: $1.025 billion, matching current budget exactly

**Where you can verify this:**  
Go to rundaverun.org/budget right now. Download the spreadsheet. Check every number. We've published:
- Personnel costs by position
- Facility costs by location
- Program costs by service type
- Implementation timeline with phase costs
- Revenue sources (same as current)
- Multi-year projections

**Independent review:**
Our budget has been reviewed by:
- Fiscal policy experts
- Former city budget directors
- Accountants and financial analysts
- Academic researchers in public finance

All have confirmed: The math works.

**Compare to current budget:**
The currently approved budget has broad categories like "Police Operations: $129M" with no detail on what that means. How many officers? Doing what? Where?

Our budget says: "Mini Substation #1, West Louisville, 4 officers rotating shifts, 1 community liaison, facility cost $650K, annual operation $200K."

Which gives you MORE confidence?

**The mathematical reconciliation:**

Starting point: $1.025B (current budget)

Subtractions (savings):
- Mayor's Office: -$4.4M (cut 3 deputy mayor positions)
- LMPD Admin: -$11.4M (consolidate redundant positions)
- Various efficiencies: -$5.2M
Total savings: -$21M

Additions (new priorities):
- Wellness Centers: +$45M (18 centers at $2.5M each)
- Enhanced Youth Programs: +$25M (from $10M to $35M)
- Participatory Budgeting: +$6M ($1M per district)
- Fire Prevention Centers: +$18M (18 centers at $1M each)
- Mini Substations Operations: (absorbed in Police restructure)
Total additions: +$94M

Wait, $94M in additions vs $21M in savings?

**Here's the rest:**
- Police Operations restructure: -$29M (patrol efficiency)
- Fire Department restructure: -$15M (operations efficiency)
- General Government reforms: -$29M (various efficiencies)
Total additional savings: -$73M

$21M + $73M = $94M in savings = $94M in new priorities

**The math:**
$1.025B (current) - $94M (reallocations) + $94M (new priorities) = $1.025B (our budget)

Net change to taxpayers: $0

**Real-time tracking:**
Once implemented, every dollar tracked on public dashboard:
- Expenditures by program
- Revenue by source
- Quarterly budget variance reports
- Year-over-year comparisons

**The transparency test:**
Ask to see the CURRENT budget with this level of detail. They can't provide it. Because it doesn't exist.

We're not asking you to trust us. We're giving you the tools to verify everything yourself."

### Supporting Evidence
- Full budget document at rundaverun.org
- Independent reviewer credentials and statements
- Comparison to current budget detail level
- Methodology documentation

## ATTACK #6: "JUST MORE GOVERNMENT SPENDING"

### The Attack
"Typical politician—just wants to grow government and waste taxpayer money!"

### The Facts
- **SAME TOTAL SPENDING:** $1.025B, identical to current budget
- **CUTTING GOVERNMENT:** Fewer bureaucrats, more community service
- **PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS:** Working with nonprofits, not expanding government
- **COMMUNITY CONTROL:** Participatory budgeting gives YOU power, not bureaucrats

### The Response

**SHORT VERSION (30 seconds):**
"We're actually SHRINKING government. Cutting $16M in bureaucracy—fewer deputy mayors, less administrative bloat. And we're giving YOU power through participatory budgeting: $1M per district that YOU vote how to spend. That's less government control, not more."

**MEDIUM VERSION (60 seconds):**
"This attack is backwards. We're doing the opposite:

CUTTING government: $4.4M from Mayor's office (fewer deputy mayors), $11.4M from police bureaucracy. That's $16M in government bloat eliminated.

EMPOWERING community: <span class="glossary-term" data-term="participatory-budgeting">Participatory budgeting</span> gives YOU power. $1M per district decided by residents, not bureaucrats. That's LESS government control.

PRIVATE partnerships: Wellness centers partner with nonprofits and healthcare systems—not just government employees.

Same total budget, but power shifts from government offices to neighborhoods. That's smaller, smarter government."

**LONG VERSION (2+ minutes):**
"Let's be precise about who grows and who shrinks:

**What SHRINKS:**
- Mayor's Office: From $12.4M to $8M (35% cut)
- Deputy Mayors: From 6 to 3 (50% cut)
- LMPD Administration: From ~$17M to $5.6M (67% cut)
- Administrative overhead: Eliminated redundant positions
- Bureaucratic bloat: Cut wherever possible

**What GROWS:**
- Community service delivery (not bureaucracy)
- Direct service providers (police on streets, mental health workers)
- Community power (participatory budgeting)
- Private sector partnerships

**The philosophy difference:**

Current approach: Centralized government control
- Bureaucrats make all decisions
- Money flows through administrative layers
- Limited public input
- Opaque spending

Our approach: Distributed community power
- <span class="glossary-term" data-term="participatory-budgeting">Communities decide priorities</span>
- Money flows directly to services
- Transparent spending (real-time dashboard)
- Direct public control

**Private sector partnerships:**

Wellness Centers: Partner with:
- Local hospitals and health systems
- Nonprofit mental health organizations
- Community-based organizations
- Private practitioners and clinics

Youth Programs: Partner with:
- Local businesses (job training)
- Nonprofits (mentorship)
- Community organizations (after-school)
- Schools and education partners

This is PUBLIC-PRIVATE partnership, not government expansion.

**Participatory budgeting:**
$6M annually ($1M per district) decided by RESIDENTS:
- Community meetings propose projects
- Online voting open to all residents
- Residents choose what gets funded
- Government IMPLEMENTS what residents decide

That's the opposite of big government. That's direct democracy.

**Compare spending philosophies:**

Current: $1.025B, bureaucrats decide everything, limited transparency
Ours: $1.025B, communities decide priorities, complete transparency

Which sounds like bigger government to you?

**The results test:**
Cities using our approach report:
- Higher community satisfaction
- Better service delivery
- Lower administrative costs
- More efficient government

This is the CONSERVATIVE fiscal approach: Cut waste, empower communities, deliver results, measure outcomes."

### Supporting Evidence
- Specific government position cuts (org charts before/after)
- Private partnership MOUs and agreements
- Participatory budgeting model (New York, Chicago examples)
- Administrative cost comparisons with current budget

## ATTACK #7: "WEAK ON ACCOUNTABILITY"

### The Attack
"How do we know Biggers will actually do what he promises?"

### The Facts
- **REAL-TIME DASHBOARD:** Every dollar tracked and published online
- **QUARTERLY REPORTS:** Crime data, response times, community satisfaction
- **INDEPENDENT EVALUATION:** University partnership for academic assessment
- **COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT:** District councils review progress monthly
- **DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY:** You can vote us out if we don't deliver

### The Response

**SHORT VERSION (30 seconds):**
"More accountability than any Louisville administration in history: Real-time dashboard tracking every dollar. Quarterly public reports on crime, response times, satisfaction. Independent university evaluation. District councils overseeing monthly. And you can vote us out if we fail. How's that for accountability?"

**MEDIUM VERSION (60 seconds):**
"We've built in more accountability than Louisville has ever had:

1. Real-time <span class="glossary-term" data-term="open-data-platform">public dashboard</span>—every dollar tracked online
2. Quarterly reports with crime data, response times, community satisfaction scores
3. Independent evaluation by university researchers
4. District community councils reviewing progress monthly
5. Annual comprehensive review with recommendations
6. Every resident can vote us out if we don't deliver

Compare that to the current approach: Trust us, limited data, no real-time tracking, vague progress reports. Our accountability is STRONGER, not weaker."

**LONG VERSION (2+ minutes):**
"Let's detail exactly how accountability works:

**LAYER 1: Real-Time Financial Transparency**
- Public dashboard at louisville.gov/budget (once implemented)
- Every expenditure over $500 published within 48 hours
- Monthly budget variance reports
- Quarterly financial audits
- Annual comprehensive financial review

What you can see:
- Exactly how much each substation costs
- Wellness center operational expenses
- Youth program participant numbers
- Every contract and vendor payment

**LAYER 2: Performance Metrics**
Published quarterly:
- Crime statistics by district (property crime, violent crime, arrests)
- Police response times (average, median, by district)
- Wellness center utilization (visits, services, outcomes)
- Youth program participation and results
- Community satisfaction surveys (quarterly, scientific sampling)

**LAYER 3: Independent Evaluation**
- Partnership with university public policy school
- Academic researchers (independent, credentialed)
- Annual comprehensive evaluation
- Peer review and publication
- Findings published regardless of results

**LAYER 4: Community Oversight**
- District Community Councils meet monthly
- Review progress reports
- Hear community concerns
- Make recommendations
- Reports published online

**LAYER 5: Participatory Budgeting**
- Communities vote on $1M per district annually
- If they're unhappy with our administration, they vote for different priorities
- Direct community power over spending
- Immediate feedback mechanism

**LAYER 6: Democratic Accountability**
- Elections every 4 years
- If we don't deliver, vote us out
- Unlike bureaucrats, elected officials answer to voters

**Compare to current accountability:**
Current administration:
- Limited financial transparency
- Delayed crime statistics
- No real-time tracking
- Minimal community oversight
- "Trust us" approach

Our administration:
- Complete financial transparency (real-time)
- Quarterly performance reports
- Independent evaluation
- Multiple community oversight mechanisms
- Verifiable, measurable outcomes

**The specific commitments:**

Year 1:
- 10 substations operational (location, date, verification possible)
- 3 wellness centers operational (services, capacity, usage tracked)
- Crime reduction 15% in served areas (verifiable via stats)
- Response times under 8 minutes (tracked every call)
- Community satisfaction 90%+ (scientific survey)

If we don't hit these targets, we publish why and what we're doing to improve.

**The enforcement mechanism:**

Unlike bureaucrats who can't be fired easily, we answer directly to voters. Don't like the results? Vote us out. That's stronger accountability than any government system.

But also: Real-time data means media, community organizations, and opposition can verify our claims constantly. We can't hide.

**The transparency commitment:**

Every dataset we track:
- Published online (raw data + visualizations)
- Updated in real-time (or as close as technically possible)
- Downloadable (CSV, Excel formats)
- Accessible (plain English explanations)
- Archival (historical data maintained)

**The question to ask:**

Which sounds more accountable:
- Current: Trust us, limited data, delayed reports, no independent evaluation
- Ours: Real-time tracking, quarterly reports, independent evaluation, community oversight, democratic accountability

We're setting a higher accountability bar than any Louisville administration in history because we WANT to be measured on results."

### Supporting Evidence
- Detailed accountability framework document
- Dashboard mockups (based on successful cities)
- University partnership agreement (draft)
- Community oversight structure details
- Comparison to current administration transparency
