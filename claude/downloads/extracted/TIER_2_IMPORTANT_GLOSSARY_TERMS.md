# Tier 2 Important Glossary Terms
## 5 High-Priority Missing Terms for Campaign Success

**Campaign:** Run Dave Run - Louisville Mayor 2026  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Important terms needed within 1 week for comprehensive coverage

---

## TERM 1: ADMINISTRATIVE BLOAT / BUREAUCRATIC WASTE

**Definition:**  
Excessive administrative staff, overhead costs, and management layers that don't directly serve residents or deliver services. Money spent on bureaucracy rather than frontline workers who actually help people.

**Louisville Context:**

**Current Administrative Overhead:**

**Mayor's Office:**
- **Current:** 6 deputy mayors + large staff
- **Budget:** $12.4M annually
- **Ratio:** 1 deputy mayor per 100,000 residents (very high)
- **Comparison:** Cities Louisville's size typically have 2-3 deputy mayors

**LMPD Administration:**
- **Current:** $17.2M for headquarters administration
- **Officers:** 150+ in administrative roles
- **Ratio:** 1 admin position per 4 patrol officers (very high)
- **Comparison:** Best-practice cities have 1 admin per 8-10 patrol

**Metro Government Overall:**
- **Administrative costs:** ~$59M across all departments
- **Front-line services:** ~$839M
- **Ratio:** 6.6% administrative overhead
- **Comparison:** Best-run cities achieve 4-5% overhead

**Where Louisville's Bureaucracy Grew:**

**2003 City-County Merger:**
- Promised to reduce duplication
- Reality: Kept staff from both governments
- Administrative positions increased rather than decreased
- Savings never fully materialized

**Department Growth:**
- Many departments have more managers than workers
- Layers: Director → Assistant Director → Division Chief → Section Head → Supervisor → Worker
- Too many people managing, not enough doing
- Approval processes require 5-7 signatures

**Examples of Bloat:**

**Example 1: Simple Permit Takes Months**
- Why: Goes through 6 departments, 12 people review
- Each reviewer has assistant, each approval takes days
- Administrative bloat = slow government

**Example 2: LMPD Overtime Crisis**
- Patrol officers work massive overtime (expensive)
- Meanwhile: 150 officers in administrative jobs
- Solution: Move admin officers to patrol, reduce overtime
- Bloat = expensive inefficiency

**Example 3: 6 Deputy Mayors**
- Each has staff of 3-5 people
- Each staff person has office, benefits, resources
- Total: 30-40 people in Mayor's office doing what?
- Most decisions still made by Mayor anyway

**Dave's Proposed Cuts:**

**Mayor's Office: $12.4M → $8M (-$4.4M)**
- Reduce 6 deputy mayors → 3 deputy mayors
- Focus: Operations, Community Engagement, Fiscal Management
- Eliminate: Duplicate functions, unnecessary positions
- Savings: Redirect to community programs

**LMPD Administration: $17.2M → $5.6M (-$11.6M)**
- Move 75 officers from administration to patrol
- Streamline command structure
- Eliminate redundant paperwork requirements
- Modernize systems to reduce admin burden
- Savings: More officers in neighborhoods, lower overtime costs

**Permitting & Licensing: Streamline**
- Reduce approval layers from 6 to 3 steps
- Online systems replace paper-pushers
- Same-day approvals for simple permits
- Result: Faster service, fewer bureaucrats needed

**Total Administrative Cuts: ~$24.2M**
- No cuts to services residents actually use
- Only cuts to overhead, bureaucracy, redundancy
- Redirected to community programs

**What Happens to Cut Positions:**

**No Mass Layoffs:**
- Attrition: Many leave naturally (retirement, other jobs)
- Reassignment: Move to frontline positions (patrol, community centers, etc.)
- Retraining: City pays for training for new roles
- Union partnership: Work with unions on transitions
- Gradual: Changes phased over 12-24 months

**Example:**
- LMPD admin officer → patrol officer (return to neighborhood beat)
- Mayor's office staffer → community wellness center coordinator
- Permit reviewer → code enforcement inspector (actually in neighborhoods)
- Result: More people serving residents, fewer shuffling papers

**Why This Matters:**

**For Taxpayers:**
- Paying for results, not bureaucracy
- $24.2M redirected to programs that work
- Better services despite same tax burden

**For Residents:**
- Faster service (fewer approval layers)
- More responsive government
- Actually see government workers in neighborhoods

**For Frontline Workers:**
- Less paperwork, more time serving people
- Clearer chain of command
- Better equipment and support (reallocated funds)

**For City Employees:**
- Better jobs (serving people instead of pushing paper)
- No layoffs (reassignments instead)
- Focus on meaningful work

**Evidence from Other Cities:**

**Philadelphia:**
- Cut administrative overhead 30% (2010-2015)
- Improved services (faster response times)
- No impact on service delivery
- Savings reinvested in neighborhood programs

**San Antonio:**
- Streamlined permitting from 45 days to 7 days
- Cut permit office staff 20%
- Customer satisfaction up 60%
- Administrative efficiency = better service

**Seattle:**
- Reduced layers of management
- Flattened hierarchy
- Faster decision-making
- Employee satisfaction improved

**How to Identify Bloat:**

**Red Flags:**
1. **Too many managers per worker** (ratio > 1:5)
2. **Slow processes** (decisions take weeks for no reason)
3. **Duplicated functions** (3 departments do same thing)
4. **Excessive meetings** (more time meeting than working)
5. **Approval chains** (5+ people must sign off)
6. **Outdated systems** (paper when digital would work)

**Louisville Has All Six.**

**Common Objections & Responses:**

**Objection:** "You're firing people!"  
**Response:** "No. We're reassigning people to better jobs serving residents. Attrition and retraining, not layoffs. We're creating 400+ new frontline positions (wellness centers, youth programs, mini substations) - people move from offices to communities."

**Objection:** "Administration is necessary."  
**Response:** "Absolutely! But there's a difference between necessary administration and bloat. We need some admin staff for payroll, HR, compliance. We don't need 6 deputy mayors when 3 can do the job better. We need lean, efficient administration - not layers of bureaucracy."

**Objection:** "This is just typical anti-government rhetoric."  
**Response:** "No, this is evidence-based government reform. Philadelphia cut 30% of admin overhead and improved services. We're not cutting government - we're cutting waste. Police budget stays same. Fire department stays same. Parks stay open. We're just doing more with the same resources by eliminating inefficiency."

**Objection:** "Cuts will hurt services."  
**Response:** "These cuts are TO bureaucracy, not services. In fact, services improve: more cops in neighborhoods, more youth programs, faster permits. Cutting waste IMPROVES services by redirecting money to what works."

**Related Terms:**
- Zero-Based Budgeting
- Efficiency
- Government Reform
- Reallocation
- Administrative Overhead
- Staffing Ratios
- Service Delivery

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"Louisville doesn't need more money - it needs to spend money smarter. Right now, we have 6 deputy mayors and 150 LMPD officers pushing paper instead of serving neighborhoods. That's $24M in bureaucratic waste. I'll cut the bloat and redirect that money to 46 mini police substations, 18 wellness centers, and youth programs. Same budget. Less waste. Better results."

---

## TERM 2: REALLOCATION

**Definition:**  
Moving funds from one budget category or program to another within the same total budget. Changing priorities without changing the overall amount spent. Not cutting the budget, just spending it differently.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Budget Reallocation Strategy:**

**Total Budget:** $1.2 billion  
**Change:** $0 (budget-neutral)  
**Reallocation:** ~$200M moved between categories

**Major Reallocations:**

**FROM (Reduce):**
1. **Mayor's Office Administration:** -$4.4M
   - 6 deputy mayors → 3 deputy mayors
   - Streamlined operations
   
2. **LMPD Administration:** -$11.6M
   - Headquarters bureaucracy reduced
   - Officers moved to patrol
   
3. **Jail Operations:** -$36.5M
   - Bail reform reduces population

5. **Other Administrative Overhead:** -$71.5M
   - Various department efficiencies
   - Technology reducing manual work
   - Process improvements

**TOTAL FREED UP: ~$200M**

**TO (Increase):**
1. **Community Policing (Mini Substations):** +$30M
   - 46 substations over 4 years
   - More officers in neighborhoods
   
2. **Community Wellness Centers:** +$45M
   - 18 centers providing health, mental health, addiction services
   - Prevention over emergency response

7. **Other Community Investments:** +$55M
   - Parks, libraries, community programs
   - Infrastructure improvements
   - Economic development

**TOTAL REDIRECTED: ~$200M**

**How Reallocation Works:**

**Step 1: Identify Savings**
- Audit all spending
- Find inefficiency, waste, low-performing programs
- Calculate realistic savings (not wishful thinking)

**Step 2: Set Priorities**
- What does Louisville need most?
- What's proven to work?
- What has community support?

**Step 3: Allocate Strategically**
- Fund priorities identified in Step 2
- Ensure total stays same as Step 1 savings
- Phase over multiple years if needed

**Step 4: Implement with Accountability**
- Track every dollar
- Measure outcomes
- Adjust based on results

**Why Reallocation (Not Cuts or Increases):**

**Not Budget Cuts:**
- Cuts = less total spending, reduced services
- Reallocation = same total, different priorities
- Distinction matters politically and practically

**Not Tax Increases:**
- Increases = asking taxpayers for more
- Reallocation = using existing resources better
- No impact on resident wallets

**Not Deficit Spending:**
- Deficit = spending more than revenue
- Reallocation = staying within revenue
- Fiscally responsible approach

**Examples from Louisville Budget:**

**Example 1: Police Administration → Patrol**
- **Reallocation:** $11.6M from LMPD headquarters to patrol
- **Result:** 46 mini substations, more community presence
- **Total police budget:** Unchanged at $379.7M
- **Impact:** Better policing with same money

**Example 2: Scattered Youth Programs → Consolidated**
- **Current:** $15M across 8 departments, duplicative
- **Reallocation:** Consolidate into one Youth Development department, add $20M
- **Total:** $35M comprehensive youth investment
- **Savings from consolidation:** $10M (eliminate duplication)
- **Impact:** Triple investment, better coordination, proven programs

**Example 3: Reactive Healthcare → Preventive**
- **Current:** Emergency response dominates spending
- **Reallocation:** Invest in 18 wellness centers ($45M)
- **Expected:** 35% reduction in ER visits (proven in other cities)
- **Healthcare system savings:** More than pays for wellness centers
- **Impact:** Better health outcomes, lower costs long-term

**Contrast with "Defunding":**

| Approach | Total Budget | Department | Services |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Defunding** | Reduced | Specific dept cut | May suffer |
| **Reallocation** | Same | Money moves | Maintained or improved |
| **Dave's Approach** | Same $1.2B | Police same, admin cut | Expanded |

**Benefits of Reallocation:**

**Politically:**
- Can't attack as "cutting" (total unchanged)
- Can't attack as "tax increase" (no new revenue)
- Forces focus on priorities, not rhetoric
- Demonstrates fiscal discipline

**Practically:**
- Must make choices (can't fund everything)
- Requires evidence (what works gets funded)
- Encourages efficiency (cut waste to fund programs)
- Sustainable (within existing revenue)

**For Residents:**
- No tax impact
- Better services from same money
- Proof government can be efficient
- Hope for transformation without cost

**Evidence:**

**Participatory Budgeting (Reallocation via Democracy):**
- 11,500 cities worldwide use this reallocation model
- NYC: Reallocates $35M annually based on resident votes
- Paris: €500M reallocated through participatory process
- Result: Better projects, higher satisfaction, same total budget

**Police Reform via Reallocation:**
- Chicago: Reallocated from administration to community policing
- Result: 30% crime reduction in pilot neighborhoods
- LA: Shifted from downtown to neighborhoods
- Result: Better response times, community trust up 35%

**Youth Investment via Reallocation:**
- Boston: Consolidated scattered programs, added prevention funding
- Result: 63% reduction in youth homicides
- Funds came from reallocation, not new taxes

**Common Objections & Responses:**

**Objection:** "Reallocation is just spin for cuts."  
**Response:** "No. Cuts reduce total budget. Reallocation keeps it the same - $1.2B. The difference: some departments get less (bureaucracy), others get more (community programs). Total unchanged. That's not spin - that's math."

**Objection:** "Departments you cut from will suffer."  
**Response:** "We're cutting waste and overhead, not services. LMPD total budget stays same - we're just moving money from administration to patrol. Mayor's office doesn't need 6 deputy mayors. Cutting bloat improves efficiency, doesn't hurt essential functions."

**Objection:** "This is just budget shuffling - nothing real changes."  
**Response:** "Tell that to the neighborhood getting a mini police substation. Or the youth in an after-school program. Or the family whose house doesn't burn down because of fire prevention. Reallocation transforms what government does - it's absolutely real."

**Objection:** "Why not just increase the budget for new priorities?"  
**Response:** "Because that requires raising taxes, which hurts families. And because we shouldn't ask taxpayers for more until we've proven we can spend existing money wisely. Reallocation forces us to prioritize and be efficient - that's good governance."

**Related Terms:**
- Budget-Neutral
- Zero-Sum Budget
- Priorities
- Opportunity Cost
- Resource Allocation
- Budget Reform
- Fiscal Responsibility

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"Every dollar spent on bureaucracy is a dollar not spent on neighborhoods. My budget reallocates $200M from waste to programs that work - same total budget, completely different priorities. No new taxes needed. Just smarter spending."

**Use in Debate:**

Moderator: "How will you pay for all these programs?"  
Dave: "Reallocation. I'm not asking for a bigger budget - Louisville already spends $1.2 billion. I'm asking to spend it better. Cut $24M in bureaucracy, invest in 46 mini substations. Consolidate scattered youth programs, triple investment to $35M. Same total. Different priorities. That's leadership."

## TERM 3: OUTCOME-BASED BUDGETING

**Definition:**  
Budget framework that allocates money based on measurable results rather than just activities or inputs. Departments receive funding tied to achieving specific outcomes, with performance tracked and funding adjusted accordingly.

**Traditional Budgeting vs. Outcome-Based:**

**Traditional (Input-Based):**
- "Fire Department gets $100M"
- "Youth Services gets 50 staff members"
- "Parks budget increases 3%"
- **Focus:** How much spent, how many people hired
- **Accountability:** Low - spending is the goal

**Outcome-Based:**
- "Fire Department reduces residential fires by 40%"
- "Youth programs reduce violence by 35% among participants"
- "Parks improve resident satisfaction to 85%"
- **Focus:** What's achieved with the money
- **Accountability:** High - results determine future funding

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Outcome-Based Framework:**

**Every Department Has:**

1. **Clear Mission:** What they're supposed to achieve
2. **Measurable Outcomes:** Specific targets
3. **Performance Indicators:** How progress is tracked
4. **Quarterly Reporting:** Regular updates
5. **Budget Adjustments:** Funding follows results

**Examples by Department:**

**Police Department:**

- Public dashboard updated daily
- If targets not met: Adjust strategy or reallocate funds
- If exceeded: Consider expansion or replication

---

**Youth Development:**

**Traditional Budget:**
- Youth programs get $35M
- Operate after-school programs, summer jobs

- School data (attendance, grades - with consent)
- Parent surveys (quarterly satisfaction)
- Job placement and retention rates

**Accountability:**
- Programs that work get expanded
- Programs that don't get revised or eliminated
- Evidence drives decisions, not politics
- Success means more funding, failure means change

- ER utilization (track enrolled patients' ER use)
- Health outcomes (blood pressure, diabetes control, etc.)
- Mental health outcomes (PHQ-9, GAD-7 scores)
- Patient satisfaction surveys

**Accountability:**
- Centers achieving outcomes continue
- Underperforming centers get technical assistance
- Best practices from high-performing centers replicated
- Community input shapes services offered

---

**Fire Prevention Centers:**

**Traditional Budget:**
- Fire gets $118M
- Fight fires, maintain stations
- Success = fires fought

**Dave's Outcome-Based Budget:**
- Fire Prevention gets $18M to achieve:
  - **Outcome 1:** 40% reduction in residential fires
  - **Outcome 2:** Free smoke detector in every home (target: 100,000 homes)
  - **Outcome 3:** Zero fire deaths from detectable causes
  - **Outcome 4:** 10,000 youth complete fire safety education

- Fire incident data (trend over time)
- Detectors installed (by neighborhood)
- Fire deaths (by cause, preventable vs. not)
- Education program participation
- Home inspection completion rates

**Accountability:**
- If fires decrease: Expand prevention model
- If targets not met: Adjust approach (different education methods, outreach strategies)
- Prevention success = shift resources from response to prevention

---

**Why Outcome-Based Budgeting Works:**

**Forces Clarity:**
- Can't hide behind activity (we're busy!) if results don't follow
- Must define what success looks like upfront
- Departments know what they're accountable for

**Enables Course Correction:**
- Quarterly reporting catches problems early
- Can adjust strategy mid-year if not working
- Don't wait for disaster to identify failure

**Rewards Success:**
- Programs that work get more funding
- Staff see connection between performance and resources
- Innovation encouraged (try new approaches to hit targets)

**Builds Trust:**
- Residents see results, not just spending
- Transparency about what's working (and what's not)
- Evidence-based governance visible to everyone

**Evidence from Other Cities:**

**Baltimore (CitiStat):**
- Implemented outcome-based budgeting 2000
- Tracked 400+ performance metrics
- Result: 30% improvement in service delivery, costs down 15%

**Los Angeles:**
- Performance-based budgeting since 2011
- Departments compete for funding based on results
- Result: Better services, more efficient spending

**Fort Lauderdale:**
- Outcome-based budget for parks, police, public works
- Result: Resident satisfaction up 45%, costs stable

**How It's Implemented:**

**Year 0 (Planning):**
- Each department defines mission
- Set 3-5 key outcomes
- Identify metrics to track
- Baseline data collected (where are we now?)
- Set realistic targets (where will we be in 1, 2, 3 years?)

**Year 1 (Implementation):**
- Departments operate toward outcomes
- Quarterly performance reports to Council
- Mid-year review: On track? Need adjustments?
- Year-end assessment: Funding decisions for Year 2

**Year 2-4 (Refinement):**
- Outcome targets raised based on Year 1 success
- Best practices shared across departments
- Underperforming programs revised or eliminated
- High-performing programs expanded

**Challenges & Solutions:**

**Challenge:** "Not everything can be measured!"  
**Solution:** True, but most things can. Customer satisfaction, response times, outcomes achieved - these are all measurable. For truly unmeasurable things (arts, culture), use qualitative assessments (community input, expert review).

**Challenge:** "This creates too much pressure on staff."  
**Solution:** Done right, outcome-based budgeting empowers staff. They know what success looks like, have resources to achieve it, and get credit for results. It's liberating compared to "just follow process."

**Challenge:** "Departments will game the metrics."  
**Solution:** Use multiple metrics (can't game all of them). Independent auditing. Community oversight. Regular review of whether metrics still make sense.

**Challenge:** "Some outcomes take years to achieve."  
**Solution:** Use short-term indicators (leading indicators) that predict long-term success. Example: Youth programs track both immediate engagement (# of participants) and long-term outcomes (violence reduction).

**Related Terms:**
- Performance Metrics
- Evidence-Based Policy
- Accountability
- Results-Oriented Government
- Data-Driven Decision Making
- Continuous Improvement
- Zero-Based Budgeting

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"Taxpayers deserve results, not just activity. My budget funds outcomes: reduce crime 35%, prevent fires 40%, serve 50,000 residents in wellness centers. Every department will report quarterly on results. If programs work, we expand them. If they don't, we fix or eliminate them. That's accountability."

**Use in Volunteer Training:**

"When someone asks 'How do you know this will work?' - that's outcome-based budgeting. We're not guessing. We've set specific targets, we're tracking progress quarterly, and we'll adjust if needed. Every taxpayer dollar is tied to a measurable result."

## TERM 4: DISTRICT COUNCILS

**Definition:**  
Elected neighborhood-level governance bodies that give residents direct voice in local decisions. In Dave's proposal: 6 District Councils (one per Metro Council district grouping) elected by residents to advise on budget priorities, review department performance, and engage communities.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's 6-District Council Proposal:**

**Structure:**

**Geographic Coverage:**
- Louisville Metro divided into 6 districts
- Roughly equal population (~100,000 residents each)
- Align with existing Metro Council districts for coordination
- Cover all neighborhoods: urban, suburban, rural

**Election:**
- Each district elects 7-member council
- Neighborhood-level representation
- Elections concurrent with Metro Council (every 4 years)
- Staggered terms for continuity (some members each cycle)

**Total: 42 elected District Council members across Louisville**

**Roles & Responsibilities:**

**1. Participatory Budgeting Oversight**
- Facilitate community input on $1M district allocation
- Review project proposals for feasibility
- Organize voting events
- Ensure process is fair and accessible
- Monitor implementation of winning projects

**2. Performance Review**
- Quarterly meetings with department heads (Police, Public Works, etc.)
- Review service delivery data (response times, outcomes)
- Community complaints channeled through Council
- Scorecard departments on performance
- Make recommendations to Mayor and Metro Council

**3. Community Engagement**
- Monthly public meetings in the district
- Town halls on specific issues
- Surveys and polls of resident priorities
- Bridge between community and city government
- Amplify neighborhood voices to city hall

**4. Development Review**

**Why District Councils:**

**Problem: City Hall Feels Distant**
- Louisville Metro is 600,000+ people
- 26-member Metro Council can't engage everyone
- Mayor's office is downtown, far from most neighborhoods
- Decisions feel like they happen TO communities, not WITH them

**Solution: Hyperlocal Democracy**
- District Councils are neighborhood-level
- 100,000 residents per district = closer connections
- Elected by neighbors to represent neighbors
- Meet in the district (not downtown)
- Accessible to working families (evening meetings, childcare provided)

**Evidence from Other Cities:**

**Portland, Oregon (Neighborhood Associations):**
- 95 officially recognized neighborhood associations
- Funded by city, govern locally
- Result: High civic engagement, responsive government

**Chicago (Community Area Council Model):**
- 77 community areas with local advisory councils
- Partner with aldermen on local issues
- Result: Better local services, community empowerment

**Barcelona, Spain (District Councils):**
- 10 district councils with elected members
- €30M+ allocated via participatory budgeting
- Result: 4x increase in civic participation

**New York City (Community Boards):**
- 59 community boards across 5 boroughs
- Review land use, budgets, services
- Result: Community voice in city decisions

**How District Councils Work:**

**Example: District 3 (West Louisville)**

**District 3 Council (7 elected members):**
- Represent neighborhoods: Russell, California, Shawnee, Chickasaw, Park DuValle, Algonquin, Parkland

**Monthly Meeting:**
- Held at community center in Russell (rotating locations)
- 7pm start (after work hours)
- Agenda:
  1. Police Chief reports on crime stats, community policing
  2. Public Works on pothole repair status
  3. Community input on participatory budget proposals
  4. Vote on land use recommendation for Metro Council
  5. Public comment period

**Participatory Budget Process:**
- $1M allocated to District 3
- Council facilitates community brainstorming (5 meetings)
- 200+ residents submit project ideas
- City staff reviews for feasibility
- Council organizes voting (online + in-person)
- 3,500 residents vote
- Winning projects: New playground, street lighting, small business grants
- Council monitors implementation

**Performance Review:**
- Quarterly: LMPD District 3 commander presents crime data
- Council asks: Why did response times increase? What's plan to address?
- Commander must respond within 30 days with action plan
- Council reports to community and Metro Council

**Powers & Limitations:**

**What District Councils CAN Do:**
- Advise Mayor and Metro Council
- Oversee participatory budgeting process
- Review and comment on development projects

- Participatory budget process begins
- Performance review protocols established

**Month 10-12 (April-June 2027):**
- First participatory budget votes
- First performance scorecards published
- First year assessment and adjustments

**Potential Challenges & Solutions:**

**Challenge:** "Who has time to run for District Council?"  
**Solution:** Stipend for council members ($5K/year) so it's not purely volunteer. Term limits (2 terms max) so it's not career. Flexible meeting schedules.

**Challenge:** "Will councils become partisan political battlegrounds?"  
**Solution:** Nonpartisan elections (like Metro Council). Focus on neighborhood issues, not national politics. Clear mission: serve community, not party.

**Challenge:** "This adds another layer of bureaucracy."  
**Solution:** Councils REPLACE some existing processes (scattered community meetings, ad-hoc engagement). They consolidate and formalize community input, making it more efficient, not less.

**Challenge:** "Councils in affluent areas will have more influence."  
**Solution:** Equal staffing and resources for all districts. Targeted outreach in underserved areas. Multilingual support. Childcare removes barrier. Democracy should empower everyone equally.

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"Louisville is too big for one-size-fits-all decisions. That's why I'm creating 6 District Councils - elected by you to represent your neighborhood. You'll have direct say on how $1M is spent in your district, how police serve your community, and how development affects your neighborhood. Real democracy, real local control."

**Use in Debate:**

Opponent: "This is just creating more bureaucracy!"  
Dave: "No, it's creating more democracy. Right now, 26 Metro Council members represent 600,000 people - that's 1 per 23,000 residents. District Councils add 42 neighborhood representatives elected at the hyperlocal level. More voices at the table means better decisions. That's not bureaucracy - that's responsive government."

Cross-department coordination body bringing together police, mental health, public health, youth services, housing, and community representatives to implement comprehensive public safety strategy. In Dave's plan: coordinates 46 mini substations, 18 wellness centers, youth programs, and co-responder teams.

**Louisville Context:**

**Dave's Proposed Community Safety Taskforce:**

**Purpose:**
Break down department silos to implement integrated safety strategy. Public safety isn't just police - it's housing, health, education, economic opportunity. Taskforce coordinates all these elements.

**Structure:**

- Quarterly public forums

**Responsibilities:**

**1. Strategic Planning**

- Youth program expansion and integration
- Mental health co-responder deployment
- Ensure all elements work together

**2. Resource Allocation**

- Rapid deployment of resources to emerging issues
- Communication with community during crises
- After-action reviews and improvements

**Why a Taskforce:**

**Problem: Siloed Departments**

**Current State:**
- LMPD addresses crime (after it happens)
- Public Health addresses health (in isolation)
- Youth services scattered across 8 departments
- Economic development doesn't coordinate with safety
- Housing doesn't talk to police
- **Result:** Fragmented, ineffective responses

**With Taskforce:**
- All departments coordinate on shared goals
- Police know when wellness centers opening (can refer people)
- Youth programs align with police mini substation locations
- Housing coordinates with safety initiatives
- Economic development considers public safety impacts
- **Result:** Integrated, effective strategy

**Example Coordination:**

**Scenario: High-Crime Neighborhood Intervention**

**Without Taskforce:**
- Police: Increase patrols (reactive)
- Youth Services: Maybe run program (if they know about it)
- Health: Unaware of issue
- Housing: Not involved
- **Result:** Temporary suppression, problem returns

**With Taskforce:**
- Police: Mini substation deployed (presence + relationships)
- Youth: After-school program 3-7pm (peak crime hours) co-located
- Health: Wellness center nearby (address trauma, mental health)
- Housing: Priority for housing stability programs
- Economic: Job training and placement for residents
- Community: District Council engaged, residents involved
- **Result:** Comprehensive intervention, sustainable change

**Evidence from Other Cities:**

**Boston (Operation Ceasefire):**
- Taskforce coordinated police, youth services, community groups
- Result: 63% reduction in youth homicides
- Key: Integration, not one department alone

**Richmond, California (Office of Neighborhood Safety):**
- Cross-department taskforce on violence reduction
- Result: 55% reduction in homicides (2007-2017)
- Key: Coordinated services for highest-risk individuals

**Newark, New Jersey (Community Safety Response Team):**
- Police + community + social services
- Result: 18% reduction in violent crime
- Key: Trust-building through coordination

4. **Program Integration:** All departments report coordinated activities
5. **Budget Efficiency:** Stay within allocated resources while hitting targets

**Challenges & Solutions:**

**Challenge:** "Departments won't want to coordinate - turf battles."  
**Solution:** Mayor's authority backs Taskforce. Budget incentives reward coordination. Data shows integrated approaches work better. Culture change starts at top.

**Challenge:** "This is just another meeting that accomplishes nothing."  
**Solution:** Action-oriented. Every meeting has decisions and assignments. Track follow-through. Hold departments accountable for commitments. Results or you're out.

**Challenge:** "Sharing data raises privacy concerns."  
**Solution:** Strict data-sharing protocols. IRB-approved research standards. Anonymized data where possible. Community oversight on use. Balance transparency with privacy.

**Example in Campaign Messaging:**

"Public safety isn't just police - it's health, housing, opportunity, education. That's why I'm creating a Community Safety Taskforce to coordinate all these elements. 46 mini substations, 18 wellness centers, youth programs, co-responders - all working together toward one goal: 35% crime reduction. That's how you actually make neighborhoods safer."

**Use in Volunteer Training:**

"When someone asks 'How will all these programs work together?' - that's the Community Safety Taskforce. It's the coordination body that ensures mini substations, wellness centers, and youth programs aren't siloed but integrated. Police know where wellness centers are to make referrals. Youth programs are near substations. Everyone's rowing in the same direction."
