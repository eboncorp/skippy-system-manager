## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE: BUDGET NUMBER INCONSISTENCY

### THE PROBLEM

Your campaign documents contain **THREE DIFFERENT budget totals**:

1. **$898.8 million** (appears in QUICK_FACTS.md, FINAL_SUMMARY_ACCURATE_FUNDING.md)
2. **$1.025 billion** (appears in CAMPAIGN_ONE_PAGER.md, MESSAGING_FRAMEWORK.md)
3. **$1.27 billion** (appears in older documents, URGENT_BUDGET_CLARIFICATION.md)

### THE REALITY

According to official Louisville Metro budget documents you uploaded:

**Mayor Greenberg's ACTUAL FY 2025-2026 Budget: $1,024,764,200**
- Approximately **$1.025 billion**
- Source: 2025-2026-executive-budget.txt, Page 49
- Confirmed: 2025-2026-detail-budget.txt, Page 12

### THE IMPACT

If opposition discovers this discrepancy:

**"Dave Biggers doesn't even know how much the budget is. He's off by hundreds of millions of dollars. How can we trust him with taxpayer money when he can't even read a budget document correctly? He's either incompetent or dishonest."**

**Result:** Campaign credibility destroyed. Game over.

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**Before distributing ANY materials:**

1. **DECIDE:** What is your actual budget proposal?
   - Option A: Match Greenberg at $1.025B ("same total, smarter priorities")
   - Option B: Propose different amount (must explain increase/decrease)

2. **FIX:** Global find/replace across ALL documents

3. **VERIFY:** All dependent calculations (percentages, comparisons)

4. **CONFIRM:** Every number is consistent and accurate
