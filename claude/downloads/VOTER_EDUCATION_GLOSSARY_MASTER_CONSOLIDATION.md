8. **Long-Term Thinking Absent:** 25-year revenue loss not justified by benefits

**What Should Have Happened:**
- **Strong Clawbacks:** Repayment if jobs not created, wages not met
- **Community Benefits Agreement:** Local hiring, training, health monitoring
- **Renewable Energy Requirement:** 100% renewable power mandate
- **Infrastructure Cost-Sharing:** PowerHouse pays proportional share
- **Transparent Process:** Public hearings, community input, full disclosure
- **ROI Analysis:** Independent analysis before approval
- **Environmental Justice Review:** Cumulative impact assessment
- **Shorter Abatement:** 10 years maximum, not 25 years

**Your Campaign Position:**
- PowerHouse exemplifies broken economic development approach
- Future incentives require strong accountability measures
- Demand community benefits in exchange for public subsidies
- Prioritize job quality and local hiring over job count
- Environmental justice must be central consideration
- Transparency and community input required
- Focus economic development on equitable outcomes
