- **$1.2B** - Referenced in Budget 3.0 and some website materials

- Some HTML files still contain $1.2B
- Campaign materials may reference older $898.8M figure

**Status of Key Figures:**
- Employee compensation: **$27.4M Year 1, 24% raises (7%+5%+5%+5%)** appears correct in most recent docs

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Mathematical reconciliation documents exist and show rigorous analysis
- ✅ Evidence-based with citations from multiple cities
- ✅ Implementation roadmaps show serious governance planning
- ✅ Multiple presentation formats (executive summary, detailed, glossary)

**Recommendation:**
- **CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED:** Which is the official budget total to use everywhere?

## BUDGET NUMBER DECISION FRAMEWORK

You must decide which budget total to use everywhere. Here are your options:

### OPTION A: $1.025 Billion
**Rationale:** Matches Greenberg's approved budget
**Message:** "Same total, different priorities"
**Documentation:** Budget 3.1 uses this figure
**Advantage:** Easy to defend - it's the current approved budget
**Files to update:** Some HTML files, some older campaign materials

### OPTION B: $1.2 Billion  
**Rationale:** Shown on some website materials and Budget 3.0
**Message:** Would require explanation of where extra funding comes from
**Documentation:** Budget 3.0 references this
**Disadvantage:** $175M higher than Greenberg - harder to defend
**Files to update:** Most recent markdown files, some HTML

### OPTION C: $898.8 Million
**Rationale:** May be an older version or stripped-down budget
**Message:** Lower than current budget - unclear narrative
**Documentation:** Some earlier campaign materials
**Disadvantage:** Much lower than current budget - confusing
**Unlikely to be correct choice**

**RECOMMENDATION:** Choose Option A ($1.025B) for these reasons:
1. Matches the official approved budget
2. Easiest to defend ("same total")
3. Most recent corrected documentation uses this
4. Simplest message discipline

## WEBSITE FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT

### What's Working ✅
- Site is live and loads fast
- Desktop navigation works
- Content is readable
- Policy pages exist
- Design is professional
- Mobile-responsive (mostly)

### What's Broken ❌
- Mobile menu button (critical UX failure)
- No donation capability
- Email signup not connected
- Gallery placeholder images
- Some text breaking mid-word

### Quick Wins (Can fix in 1-2 hours)
1. Deploy word-break CSS fix
2. Add donation button link (even if just to generic page temporarily)
3. Connect email form to Mailchimp
4. Fix mobile menu JavaScript
5. Upload 4-6 campaign photos

---

## DOCUMENT VERSION CONFUSION

**Problem:** Multiple versions of key documents exist with unclear status

**Example - Campaign One-Pager:**
- campaign_one_pager_IMPROVED.md
- campaign_one_pager_RESTRUCTURED.md  
- CAMPAIGN_ONE_PAGER.md
- CAMPAIGN_ONE_PAGER_v3.md

**Which should volunteers use?**

**Solution Needed:**
Create `OFFICIAL_CURRENT_VERSIONS.md` that lists:
- Campaign One-Pager: `CAMPAIGN_ONE_PAGER_v3.md` ← USE THIS
- Budget Summary: `Budget_3.1_Summary.md` ← USE THIS
- Etc.

Mark outdated files with `_ARCHIVE_` or `_OLD_` prefix

---

## STRENGTHS TO LEVERAGE

### What's Excellent ✅

**1. Policy Depth**
Your implementation guides (Mini Substations, Wellness Centers, Participatory Budgeting) are exceptional. This demonstrates serious governance readiness that most campaigns lack.

**2. Evidence Base**
Citations from 50+ cities provide strong defense against "unproven" attacks.

**3. Opposition Preparation**
12-page opposition attack response guide is comprehensive and shows strategic sophistication.

**4. Louisville-Specific Content**
Day in the Life scenarios use actual neighborhoods and situations, showing local knowledge.

**5. Technical Infrastructure**
WordPress plugin, GitHub CI/CD, professional design system show technical competence.

**6. Documentation Quality**
Most documents are professionally written and campaign-ready.

---

## GAPS REQUIRING ATTENTION

### What's Missing or Incomplete ⚠️

**1. Campaign Operations Budget**
No fundraising goals, expense projections, or financial plan for running the campaign itself.

**2. Field Organization**
While you have great volunteer materials, unclear if actual field structure exists (offices, staff hierarchy, organizing model).

**3. Voter Targeting**
No precinct-level strategy, persuasion universes defined, or contact goals evident.

**4. Social Media Presence**
Strategy exists but unclear if accounts are active and posting regularly.

**5. Opposition Files**
Responses to attacks exist, but comprehensive research on opponents missing.

**6. Working Website Functions**
Design is good but key functionality broken or missing.

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

### Overall Grade: B+ (Strong Foundation, Needs Execution)

**What You've Done Exceptionally Well:**
- ✅ Policy development and implementation planning
- ✅ Campaign materials creation
- ✅ Technical infrastructure (mostly)
- ✅ Documentation and organization
- ✅ Evidence-based approach

**What Needs Immediate Attention:**
- ❌ Budget number standardization
- ❌ Website functionality fixes
- ❌ Campaign operational budget and fundraising
- ❌ Field operations structure
- ❌ Social media activation

**Bottom Line:**
You have built 75-85% of what's needed for a competitive mayoral campaign. This is significantly more developed than the initial assessment suggested. The main gaps are:

1. **Execution infrastructure** (staff, offices, organizational structure)
2. **Money operation** (fundraising plan and campaign budget)
3. **Technical fixes** (website issues)
4. **Consistency** (budget numbers, document versions)

With 2-4 weeks of focused work addressing these gaps, you'll have a formidable campaign operation. The policy foundation you've built is exceptional and gives you a significant advantage over typical campaigns.

The question isn't whether you have enough materials - you do. The question is whether you can:
- Fix the critical technical issues
- Decide on consistent messaging (budget numbers)
- Build the operational team and structure
- Execute on the foundation you've built

**Recommendation:** Do NOT attempt to create more materials. Instead, focus 100% on:
1. Fixing what's broken (website, consistency)
2. Building what's missing (team, budget, field structure)
3. Executing with what you have (it's plenty)

You're much further along than you may realize. Time to shift from planning to execution.
