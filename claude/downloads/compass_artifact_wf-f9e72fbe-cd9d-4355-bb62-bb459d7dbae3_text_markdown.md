# Glossary & Search Implementation Guide for Louisville Campaign

**The optimal approach combines the "Glossary by Codeat" WordPress plugin with Fuse.js search, vanilla JavaScript, and mobile-first design to create a WCAG 2.1 AA compliant glossary that can be implemented in 4-6 hours.** This solution provides built-in Schema.org DefinedTerm markup for SEO, automatic internal linking, and excellent user experience for everyday Louisville voters while remaining efficient for Claude Code to implement. Research across government sites, civic education platforms, and accessibility standards reveals that alphabetical organization with category filtering, 8th-9th grade reading level, and individual term pages delivers the best combination of usability, discoverability, and SEO value for 91 terms.

## The implementation landscape

WordPress glossary solutions range from simple plugins requiring 1-2 hours of setup to fully custom implementations taking 16-30 hours. For a mayoral campaign with 91 civic education terms, the research strongly favors **plugin-based solutions enhanced with custom search functionality** over building from scratch. Government glossaries from Seattle, Minneapolis, NYC, and Chicago demonstrate that even major cities use straightforward alphabetical organization with plain language definitions averaging 2-3 sentences. The most successful civic education glossaries prioritize accessibility and clarity over complex features, with reading levels targeted at 8th-9th grade to reach broad audiences without compromising technical accuracy.

Modern JavaScript search libraries have matured significantly, with client-side solutions now handling 100+ terms instantly without server-side processing. The research identified **Fuse.js as the optimal library for government terminology** due to its superior fuzzy search capabilities—critical for handling terms like "appropriation" and "fiscal year" that voters commonly misspell. With 19,600+ GitHub stars and active maintenance through 2024, Fuse.js provides the reliability needed for campaign infrastructure while requiring minimal implementation complexity.

## WordPress plugin recommendation

**Glossary by Codeat emerges as the clear winner** among seven evaluated WordPress plugins. Updated October 2025 with 2,000+ installs and 4.7/5 rating, it's the only free plugin offering **built-in Schema.org DefinedTerm markup**—critical for SEO and rich search results. The plugin provides automatic term linking throughout your site, CSV import for rapid deployment of 91 terms, customizable tooltips with four free themes, category grouping, and ChatGPT integration for definition assistance. The free version includes sufficient features for campaign needs, though premium ($59-89) adds footnotes, advanced mobile controls, and additional styling options.

Alternative options include CM Tooltip Glossary (most mature with 10,000+ installs, 12+ years development, stronger tooltip features but no free Schema support) and Heroic Glossary (simplest option, pure Gutenberg blocks, best for basic use cases without tooltips). For campaigns requiring maximum control or having specific technical requirements, a **custom post type (CPT) approach with Advanced Custom Fields** offers complete flexibility while leveraging WordPress core functionality, though requiring 8-16 hours development time versus 1.5 hours for plugin setup.

**Implementation approach:** Install Glossary by Codeat, configure settings (15 min), import 91 terms via CSV (20 min), customize tooltip appearance and colors (15 min), configure SEO settings and URL structure (15 min), test across devices (30 min). Total implementation: 1.5 hours. Add 2-3 hours for content entry if not using CSV import.

## Search functionality architecture

For 91 terms, **client-side search is definitively superior to server-side** processing. Research demonstrates that modern JavaScript libraries can search, filter, and return results in 5-20ms with zero network latency, while consuming only 30-50KB of bandwidth for the complete dataset including search library. This approach works offline, eliminates server load, requires no backend infrastructure, and provides instant feedback essential for good user experience.

**Fuse.js v7.1.0 technical specifications:**
- Bundle size: 24KB minified (acceptable overhead)
- Performance: 5-20ms search on 91 terms
- Features: Fuzzy matching, weighted field search, match highlighting, threshold configuration
- Zero dependencies, ES5-compliant for maximum compatibility
- Search threshold: 0.3 recommended (balances fuzzy matching with accuracy)
- Keys configuration: Weight term name 2x, definition 1x for relevance ranking

**Essential search features to implement:**
- **Search-as-you-type** with 250-300ms debounce delay (prevents excessive processing while maintaining responsiveness)
- **Autocomplete suggestions**: Display 6-8 results on mobile, 10 on desktop, with keyboard navigation support
- **Category filtering**: Allow users to narrow by Budget, Government, Health, Criminal Justice topics
- **"Did you mean" suggestions**: Show when query returns fewer than 3 results, using Levenshtein distance to identify closest matches
- **Empty state messaging**: "No results for 'xyz'" with alternative actions like browsing all terms or viewing popular searches

**Synonym handling strategy:** For specialized government terminology, manual mapping provides better results than algorithmic approaches. Create a synonym dictionary mapping common terms to official vocabulary: "taxes" → "revenue," "spending" → "appropriation," "law" → "ordinance." This requires 2-3 hours initial setup but significantly improves search success rates.

**Mobile search optimization:** Use `type="search"` with `inputmode="search"` attributes, disable autocorrect/autocapitalize (confusing for proper nouns), ensure 16px minimum font size (prevents iOS zoom), provide 48x48px minimum touch targets, and implement touch-friendly result cards with adequate spacing.

## Content structure and writing best practices

Government plain language guidelines, federal accessibility standards, and analysis of successful civic glossaries converge on consistent recommendations for glossary content. **Target 8th-9th grade reading level** using Flesch-Kincaid scoring (testable in Microsoft Word). This isn't "dumbing down"—PlainLanguage.gov explicitly debunks this misconception, noting that plain language serves all audiences by reducing cognitive load and improving comprehension speed.

**Definition structure template:**
- **Sentence 1**: Core definition in simplest terms (what it is)
- **Sentence 2**: Context or why it matters (how it's used in Louisville government)
- **Sentence 3**: Example or Louisville-specific application (when helpful for complex terms)
- **Optimal length**: 1-4 sentences, typically 2-3

**Example application:**
"**Fiscal Year** - The 12-month period used for budgeting and financial reporting. In Louisville Metro, the fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30, different from the January-December calendar year. The Mayor proposes the budget for the upcoming fiscal year each April."

**Organization strategy:** All examined government glossaries (Seattle, Minneapolis, NYC, Chicago, GAO) use alphabetical organization as primary structure. For 91 terms, use **pure alphabetical A-Z listing with supplemental category tags** for optional filtering. This meets universal user expectations, enables fast lookups, works seamlessly with Ctrl+F browser search, and avoids categorization debates about where terms belong. Category badges (Budget & Finance, Government Structure, Health & Social Services, Criminal Justice, Process Terms) provide filtering without disrupting alphabetical flow.

**Louisville-specific integration pattern:** Define terms universally first, then add local context in parenthetical or second sentence. "**City Council** - The legislative body that creates laws and approves budgets for local government. Louisville Metro Council has 26 members representing districts across Jefferson County, with each member serving four-year terms." This approach makes definitions useful beyond Louisville while maintaining local relevance.

**Cross-referencing strategy:** Use selectively to connect related concepts without cluttering definitions. Employ "See" references for synonyms ("Metro Council - See Metropolitan Council") and "See also" for related concepts at definition end ("Operating Budget - [definition]. See also: Capital Budget, Fiscal Year, Appropriation"). For 91 terms, limit cross-references to genuinely helpful connections rather than linking exhaustively.

## Technical implementation for Claude Code

**Vanilla JavaScript is strongly preferred over React** for AI-assisted implementation. Vanilla JS requires no build process (Webpack/Babel), eliminates 40KB+ framework overhead, provides direct DOM manipulation easier for debugging, integrates natively with WordPress, and allows progressive enhancement. Modern ES6+ features provide sufficient functionality for glossary and search without framework complexity. React introduces build troubleshooting challenges, potential WordPress conflicts, and represents overkill for a 91-term glossary's technical requirements.

**Recommended tech stack:**
- **Backend**: WordPress plugin structure (PHP)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ with Fuse.js library
- **Data format**: JSON file stored in plugin directory
- **Styling**: Mobile-first CSS with CSS custom properties
- **API**: WordPress REST API for term delivery
- **Build process**: None required (simplifies maintenance)

**JSON data structure for 91 terms:**

```json
{
  "glossary": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-10-27",
    "totalTerms": 91,
    "terms": [
      {
        "id": "fiscal-year",
        "term": "Fiscal Year",
        "definition": "The 12-month period used for budgeting...",
        "category": "budget",
        "relatedTerms": ["budget-cycle", "appropriation"],
        "aliases": ["FY", "financial year"],
        "examples": ["Louisville's fiscal year runs July 1 - June 30"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**WordPress plugin structure:**

```php

## Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Government websites must meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards**—this is non-negotiable for civic education content. The complete implementation checklist ensures Louisville voters using assistive technologies can access glossary content equally.

**Critical success criteria:**
- **4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio** for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+) and UI components
- **44×44px minimum touch target size** for all interactive elements (buttons, links, accordion toggles)
- **Visible focus indicators** on all interactive elements (3px solid outline, distinct color, 2px offset)
- **Keyboard accessibility**: Full navigation without mouse, no keyboard traps, logical tab order
- **ARIA live regions** for dynamic content announcements to screen readers
- **Semantic HTML**: `<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>` for definition lists, `<button>` for interactive elements, proper heading hierarchy

**Accessible search implementation:**

```html
<div role="search" class="glossary-search">
  <label for="glossary-search-input">Search glossary terms</label>
  <input 
    type="search"
    id="glossary-search-input"
    autocomplete="off"
    aria-describedby="search-help"
    placeholder="Enter term..."
  />
  <p id="search-help" class="sr-only">
    Results update as you type
  </p>
  <button type="submit" aria-label="Search glossary">
    <svg aria-hidden="true"><!-- search icon --></svg>
    Search
  </button>
  
  <!-- ARIA live region for screen reader announcements -->
  <div id="search-status" 
       role="status" 
       aria-live="polite" 
       aria-atomic="true" 
       class="sr-only"></div>
</div>

<div id="results" aria-label="Glossary search results"></div>
```

**JavaScript accessibility pattern:**

```javascript
class AccessibleGlossary {
  constructor() {
    this.searchInput = document.getElementById('glossary-search-input');
    this.statusRegion = document.getElementById('search-status');
    this.resultsContainer = document.getElementById('results');
    this.initFuseSearch();
    this.bindEvents();
  }
  
  initFuseSearch() {
    this.fuse = new Fuse(glossaryData, {
      keys: [
        { name: 'term', weight: 2 },
        { name: 'definition', weight: 1 }
      ],
      threshold: 0.3,
      minMatchCharLength: 2
    });
  }
  
  bindEvents() {
    this.searchInput.addEventListener('input', 
      this.debounce(this.handleSearch.bind(this), 300));
  }
  
  handleSearch(e) {
    const query = e.target.value.trim();
    if (query.length < 2) {
      this.displayAllTerms();
      return;
    }
    
    const results = this.fuse.search(query);
    this.displayResults(results);
    this.announceResults(results.length, query);
  }
  
  announceResults(count, query) {
    const message = count === 0 
      ? `No results found for "${query}"`
      : `${count} ${count === 1 ? 'result' : 'results'} found`;
    this.statusRegion.textContent = message;
  }
  
  debounce(fn, delay) {
    let timeout;
    return (...args) => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
      timeout = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
    };
  }
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => new AccessibleGlossary());
```

**Mobile-first CSS with accessibility:**

```css
:root {
  --color-text: #1a1a1a;
  --color-background: #ffffff;
  --color-primary: #0056b3;
  --color-focus: #0056b3;
  --touch-target: 48px;
  --font-base: 16px;
  --line-height: 1.5;
}

/* Screen reader only class */
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border: 0;
}

/* Focus indicators */
*:focus {
  outline: 3px solid var(--color-focus);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Touch targets */
.glossary-search button,
.accordion-toggle {
  min-width: var(--touch-target);
  min-height: var(--touch-target);
  padding: 12px 16px;
}

/* Base typography */
body {
  font-size: var(--font-base);
  line-height: var(--line-height);
  color: var(--color-text);
  background: var(--color-background);
}

/* Definition list styling */
.glossary-terms dt {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 700;
  margin-top: 2em;
}

.glossary-terms dd {
  margin-left: 0;
  margin-top: 0.5em;
  font-size: 16px;
  max-width: 65ch;
}

/* Search input */
.glossary-search input {
  width: 100%;
  min-height: var(--touch-target);
  font-size: var(--font-base);
  padding: 12px 16px;
  border: 2px solid #ccc;
}

/* Responsive scaling */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .glossary-search {
    display: flex;
    gap: 8px;
  }
  
  .glossary-search input {
    flex: 1;
  }
  
  .glossary-search button {
    width: auto;
  }
}
```

**Testing checklist:**
- Keyboard-only navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space)
- Screen reader testing (NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac/iOS)
- Color contrast verification (WebAIM Contrast Checker)
- Touch target measurement (browser dev tools)
- Zoom to 200% without horizontal scroll
- Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)

## UX and design patterns

**Layout recommendation: Accordion with "Expand All" functionality.** Research shows accordions work excellently for 91 terms, reducing cognitive load and minimizing scrolling while maintaining overview through visible term names. Critical requirements: allow multiple accordions open simultaneously (users may need to compare definitions), include "Expand All / Collapse All" toggle buttons for flexibility, ensure proper ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `role="button"` on triggers), automatically expand all for print, and use clear iconography (caret or chevron icons rotating to indicate state).

Alternative hybrid approach: Display first 2-3 sentences of each definition with "Read more" expansion for longer content. This balances scannability with full accessibility while requiring less interaction than fully collapsed accordions.

**Typography specifications for scannability:**
- **Body text**: 16-18px minimum (16px for fonts with large x-height like Helvetica, 18px for smaller x-height fonts)
- **Term headings**: 20-24px, bold weight
- **Line height**: 1.5x for body text (promotes horizontal eye movement), 1.2-1.3x for headings
- **Line length**: 45-80 characters per line optimal (66 characters ideal), enforced with max-width: 65ch in CSS
- **Spacing**: 32-48px between term entries, 16-24px within definitions, 2x font size paragraph spacing
- **Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between term name, category badge, definition, and examples

**Sticky search bar implementation:** For 91 terms, research strongly supports sticky/persistent search. Studies show 22% reduction in navigation time, with 100% of tested users preferring sticky navigation for reference content. Implementation: 50-60px height maximum, contains search input + "Expand All" button + optional category filter, fixed position or partially persistent (hides on scroll down, reappears on scroll up—recommended for mobile to save screen space), sufficient contrast from content background, accounts for mobile virtual keyboard.

**Visual engagement strategies without sacrificing professionalism:**
- **Category badges**: Pill-shaped badges (24-28px height, rounded corners, 12-14px font) in 5-7 distinct colors aligned with campaign topics
- **Color-coded left borders**: 4px solid colored bar on left of each term block matching category
- **Icons**: Small 24x24px category icons (governance 🏛️, budget 💰, health ❤️, criminal justice ⚖️, etc.) using consistent icon library like Font Awesome
- **Alternating backgrounds**: Subtle alternating row colors (#f9f9f9 / #ffffff) for definition blocks
- **Highlight search matches**: Use `<mark>` HTML element with yellow background (#FFFF00) and dark text, ensuring 3:1 contrast

**A-Z jump link navigation:** Horizontal row of alphabet letters at top, sticky with search bar, current letter highlighted/bolded, disabled letters (no terms) greyed out, smooth scroll to anchor points accounting for sticky header height using CSS `scroll-padding-top`, mobile: horizontal scroll or wrap to 2-3 rows.

**Print and PDF export:** Essential for campaign volunteers and offline reference. Implement via WordPress "Print Friendly & PDF" plugin or custom CSS print stylesheet. Print stylesheet should: expand all accordions, hide interactive elements (search, sticky nav), use 12pt font size, add page breaks after major sections, include page numbers and glossary URL in footer, ensure black-and-white readability. Provide downloadable PDF option with professional typography, campaign branding, table of contents with page numbers, and "Last updated" date.

## Selective multimedia integration

Research demonstrates multimedia improves retention rates by up to 60% compared to text-only content, with visual learners (65% of population) retaining 80% of visual information versus 20% of text. However, **for 91-term campaign glossary, recommend selective multimedia use** to balance engagement with performance and production costs.

**Video recommendations:**
- Produce 5-8 explainer videos maximum for most complex/critical terms
- Priority terms: Ranked Choice Voting, Budget Process, Metro Government Structure, Zoning, Bond Issues
- Format: 60-90 seconds, mix of talking head + animated infographics
- Host on YouTube, embed with lazy loading in glossary
- Mandatory: Closed captions for accessibility, transcripts below video
- Production cost estimate: $500-2,000 per professional video, or DIY with campaign staff for $0-200
- Loading optimization: Use lazy loading, poster image, click-to-play rather than autoplay

**Infographics for:**
- Government organizational structure (Louisville Metro hierarchy)
- Budget allocation pie charts (where tax dollars go)
- Election process flowcharts (how bills become ordinances)
- Geographic maps (ward boundaries, districts)
- Format: Static PNG/SVG with click-to-expand, comprehensive alt text describing visual content, downloadable versions available

**Total multimedia recommendations:**
- Text definitions: All 91 terms
- Category icons: 8-10 small icons total (used repeatedly)
- Videos: 5-8 for complex terms maximum
- Infographics: 5-8 for visual concepts
- Target page size: Under 2MB with lazy loading
- Loading strategy: Above-fold content loads first, multimedia lazy loads on scroll or user interaction

**Multimedia to avoid:**
- Audio pronunciations (low priority for standard English civic terms)
- Auto-playing content (accessibility and UX problems)
- Decorative animations (inappropriate for campaign credibility)
- Excessive images (cognitive clutter for text-focused glossary)

## Analytics and continuous improvement

**Essential Google Analytics 4 event tracking:**

```javascript
// Search event
gtag('event', 'search', {
  search_term: query,
  page_location: '/glossary'
});

// Accordion expansion
gtag('event', 'glossary_term_view', {
  term_name: termName,
  category: termCategory,
  position_in_list: termPosition
});

// Category filter usage
gtag('event', 'glossary_filter', {
  category_selected: categoryName,
  results_count: filteredTermsCount
});

// Failed search (no results)
gtag('event', 'search_no_results', {
  search_term: query
});

// Helpful feedback
gtag('event', 'term_feedback', {
  term_name: termName,
  helpful: yesOrNo
});

// PDF download
gtag('event', 'file_download', {
  file_name: 'campaign-glossary.pdf'
});
```

**Critical metrics to track:**
- **Search behavior**: All search queries, most searched terms, searches with zero results (identifies missing terms), search refinements (query changes)
- **Term engagement**: Which terms opened most (accordion tracking), time spent per term, scroll depth through 91-term list
- **Navigation patterns**: A-Z jump link usage, category filter selections, "Expand All" button clicks
- **Conversion funnels**: Glossary → policy pages, glossary → donation page, glossary → volunteer signup
- **Failed searches**: Terms users seek but don't find (weekly review to add missing terms)

**Hotjar implementation for qualitative insights:**
- Heatmaps: See which terms get most attention/clicks
- Scroll maps: Identify how far users scroll through 91 terms (reveals engagement dropoff points)
- Session recordings: Watch 10-20 actual user sessions monthly to identify UX friction
- Free tier: 35 sessions/day (sufficient for campaign site traffic)
- Setup: Install Hotjar WordPress plugin, create heatmap for glossary page URL

**User feedback mechanisms:**
- **"Was this helpful?" widget** after each definition: Thumbs up/down buttons, optional "Tell us why" text field, track responses in GA4, weekly review of negative feedback
- **"Suggest a term" form** at bottom of glossary: Fields for term name, definition suggestion, why it matters, optional email for follow-up
- **"Report error" link** per term: Opens modal with pre-filled term name, issue type dropdown (error/clarification needed/update needed), description field
- Integration: Use WPForms or Gravity Forms, route submissions to campaign CRM with "Glossary" tags, auto-responder confirms receipt, weekly digest to content manager

**A/B testing priorities:**

**Phase 1 (Weeks 2-4):**
- **Test**: Sticky search bar ON vs OFF
- **Metric**: Search usage rate, time to find specific term
- **Hypothesis**: Sticky search increases usage by 40%+

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-7):**
- **Test**: Accordion default state (all collapsed vs first 5 expanded)
- **Metric**: Accordion open rate, bounce rate, time on page
- **Hypothesis**: First 5 expanded reduces interaction cost without overwhelming

**Phase 3 (Month 2):**
- **Test**: Definition length (brief 2 sentences vs detailed paragraph vs layered with "Read more")
- **Metric**: Engagement rate, user feedback scores
- **Hypothesis**: Layered approach optimizes scannability + depth

**Testing tool recommendation:** Nelio A/B Testing plugin ($29/month) provides WordPress-native A/B testing with heatmaps, AI-assisted test suggestions, and no coding required. For low-traffic campaign sites, run each test 3-4 weeks minimum for statistical significance (need 100-350 visitors per variation).

**Success metrics (3-month benchmarks):**
- Average time on page: >2 minutes (indicates engagement)
- Bounce rate: <60% (reasonable for reference content)
- Search usage: >40% of visitors use search
- Failed searches: <5% of total searches return no results
- Glossary → conversion: 5-8% click through to action pages
- Helpful feedback: >70% positive ratings

## SEO strategy for maximum discoverability

**Individual pages vs single-page decision:** For 91 terms, **individual pages decisively superior for SEO**. Each term becomes unique indexable URL targeting long-tail keywords, creating 91 potential Google entry points versus 1. Structure: `/glossary/term-slug/` format enables breadcrumbs (Home > Glossary > Term Name), individual meta descriptions optimized per term, internal linking opportunities between related terms, and deep linking from blog posts/policy pages to specific definitions.

Single-page glossary advantages (better UX for browsing all at once) can be retained by also maintaining `/glossary/` index page that lists all terms, achieving both goals.

**Schema.org DefinedTerm markup (CRITICAL):**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "DefinedTerm",
  "name": "Fiscal Year",
  "description": "The 12-month period used for budgeting and financial reporting. In Louisville Metro, the fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.",
  "inDefinedTermSet": {
    "@type": "DefinedTermSet",
    "name": "Louisville Campaign Glossary"
  }
}
```

Benefits: Rich snippets in Google search results, potential for Answer Box placement, 10-30% CTR improvement over standard results, knowledge panel eligibility. **Only Glossary by Codeat plugin provides this automatically in free version**—significant advantage requiring no custom development.

**Internal linking strategy:** Configure plugin to automatically link first occurrence of glossary terms throughout site content (policy pages, blog posts, endorsements). This distributes page authority across glossary terms, improves crawlability by creating link network, enhances user experience by defining terms in context, increases time on site, and reduces bounce rate. Avoid over-linking (link term only once per page) and self-references (don't link term to itself).

**XML sitemap inclusion:** Ensure all 91 glossary term pages included in WordPress XML sitemap (Yoast SEO or Rank Math handle automatically). Submit sitemap to Google Search Console. Priority: Set glossary pages to 0.6-0.7 priority (below main campaign pages but above blog posts).

**Performance optimization:** Fast loading critical for both SEO and user experience.

**Performance stack:**
- **WP Rocket** ($59/year): Page caching, minification, lazy loading images, database optimization—provides 300-500% performance improvement with one-click activation
- **Cloudflare** (free tier): CDN for static assets, DDoS protection, SSL, reduces server load
- **Redis object caching**: If available on hosting, dramatically reduces database queries
- **Image optimization**: ShortPixel or Smush Pro for compressing category icons, infographics
- **Target metrics**: First Contentful Paint <1.8s, Largest Contentful Paint <2.5s, Time to Interactive <3.5s (Google Core Web Vitals)

## Key considerations for Claude Code

Claude Code as an AI coding tool will handle this implementation most efficiently with:

**Structured, clear specifications:**
- Complete JSON schema for 91 terms with all required fields
- Exact CSS class names and structure
- Detailed JavaScript function specifications with input/output examples
- WordPress plugin structure with file organization

**Vanilla JavaScript over frameworks:**
- No build process eliminates webpack/babel configuration complexity
