## What Is This?

The Claude Protocol System is a comprehensive set of standardized procedures and workflows for development work with Claude Code. Think of it as your persistent memory and operations manual across all Claude Code sessions.

**In Simple Terms**: Instead of re-explaining your workflows and preferences to Claude each time, these protocols provide consistent, detailed instructions that persist across all sessions.
