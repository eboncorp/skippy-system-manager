Chronic absenteeism has doubled since the pandemic. Achievement gaps between Black and white students remain massive. Thousands of young people lack access to after-school programs, summer jobs, or pathways to careers. Meanwhile, school buildings crumble from deferred maintenance, teachers leave due to low pay and impossible working conditions, and families struggle to afford childcare that costs more than college tuition.<\/p>\n<p>Dave Biggers believes every Louisville child deserves an excellent education and meaningful opportunities\u2014regardless of their zip code, race, or family income. While the mayor doesn't control Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS), Louisville Metro Government has enormous power to support students, families, and educators through strategic partnerships, direct services, and community investment.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge<\/h3>\n<p>Louisville's education and youth development crisis shows up in stark numbers:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Academic Achievement Crisis:<\/strong> Only 34-35% of JCPS students are proficient in reading; 27-28% in math. Black students proficient at 28% (reading) and 22% (math)\u2014half the rate of white students.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Chronic Absenteeism Emergency:<\/strong> 38% of JCPS students chronically absent (missing 10%+ of school days)\u2014doubled from 19% pre-pandemic. In some schools, over 60% chronically absent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Opportunity Gaps:<\/strong> 15,000+ JCPS students lack access to after-school programs. Only 2,000 summer jobs available for 25,000+ youth who need them. Early childhood education serves &lt;30% of eligible low-income children.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>School Infrastructure Decay:<\/strong> $1 billion+ in deferred maintenance. Schools without air conditioning. Lead in water. Crumbling facilities in West Louisville while East End schools receive investments.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Youth Violence &amp; Trauma:<\/strong> 180+ homicides annually; many victims and witnesses are children and teens. 60%+ of JCPS students experience trauma (violence, abuse, housing instability, food insecurity).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3 id=\"daves-vision\">Dave's Vision<\/h3>\n<p>Dave will make Louisville a city that invests in every child's success through comprehensive education and youth development partnerships:<\/p>\n<p><strong>After-School Programs Expansion ($12M annually):<\/strong> Universal access to free, quality after-school programs in all neighborhoods\u2014serving 15,000+ additional students with homework help, enrichment, meals, and safe spaces.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Youth Employment Program ($8M annually):<\/strong> 2,000+ paid summer jobs and year-round internships for Louisville youth, with pathways to careers in city government, nonprofits, and local businesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early Childhood Education Expansion ($5M annually):<\/strong> Triple Louisville's investment in pre-K and childcare, serving 1,500 additional children and supporting childcare workers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Library System Expansion ($2M annually):<\/strong> Extended hours, new branches in underserved areas, literacy programs, and technology access for students and families.<\/p>\n<p><strong>School Support Partnerships ($1M annually):<\/strong> Direct support for JCPS through social workers, mental health counselors, attendance interventions, and facility improvements.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"budget-impact\">Budget Impact<\/h3>\n<p>This policy requires <strong>$28 million in new annual spending<\/strong>\u2014funded through reallocation from ineffective violence prevention contracts, new federal funding partnerships, and evidence-based investments that pay for themselves through improved educational outcomes and reduced youth justice system costs.<\/p>\n<p>All proposals fit within Louisville Metro's $1.2 billion annual general fund budget.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"why-this-matters\">Why This Matters<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Education is the foundation of opportunity.<\/strong> When children succeed in school, they escape poverty, avoid the criminal justice system, and contribute to Louisville's prosperity. When children fail, our entire community pays the price\u2014through crime, unemployment, poverty, and lost potential.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Youth development prevents violence.<\/strong> Research is clear: structured after-school programs, summer jobs, and positive adult mentorship reduce youth involvement in violence by 40-60%. Investing in young people prevents problems rather than paying to manage crises.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Louisville's prosperity depends on our children's success.<\/strong> Companies choose cities with educated workforces. Talent stays in cities with opportunities for young people. Families move to cities that invest in children.<\/p>\n<p>Dave's education and youth development agenda will ensure every Louisville child has the support, opportunities, and resources they need to thrive.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 id=\"current-situation-education-youth-in-crisis\">CURRENT SITUATION: EDUCATION &amp; YOUTH IN CRISIS<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"by-the-numbers\">By the Numbers<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Academic Achievement:<\/strong>\n- <strong>Reading Proficiency (JCPS):<\/strong> 34-35% overall; 28% Black, 58% white (30-point gap)\n- <strong>Math Proficiency (JCPS):<\/strong> 27-28% overall; 22% Black, 56% white (34-point gap)\n- <strong>High School Graduation Rate:<\/strong> 81% overall; 74% Black, 88% white\n- <strong>College Enrollment:<\/strong> 52% of JCPS graduates enroll; 38% Black, 68% white\n- <strong>Chronic Absenteeism:<\/strong> 38% of students (up from 19% pre-pandemic)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Youth Opportunities:<\/strong>\n- <strong>After-School Program Access:<\/strong> 12,000 students served; 15,000+ on waitlists\n- <strong>Summer Youth Employment:<\/strong> 2,000 jobs; 25,000+ eligible youth (8% served)\n- <strong>Early Childhood Education:<\/strong> 1,500 children in Metro-funded pre-K; 6,000+ eligible\n- <strong>Library Access:<\/strong> Average 40 hours\/week; closed Sundays; 4 branches in underserved areas need expansion<\/p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure &amp; Support:<\/strong>\n- <strong>JCPS Deferred Maintenance:<\/strong> $1 billion+ backlog\n- <strong>School Social Workers:<\/strong> 1 per 1,000 students (national standard: 1 per 250)\n- <strong>School Counselors:<\/strong> 1 per 430 students (national standard: 1 per 250)\n- <strong>School Nurses:<\/strong> 1 per 1,200 students (national standard: 1 per 750)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Youth Violence &amp; Justice:<\/strong>\n- <strong>Youth Homicide Victims (under 21):<\/strong> 35-40 annually\n- <strong>Youth Arrested:<\/strong> 2,500+ annually\n- <strong>Students Experiencing Trauma:<\/strong> 60%+ (violence, abuse, housing instability, food insecurity)\n- <strong>Suspension\/Expulsion:<\/strong> Black students 3x more likely than white students<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"major-problems\">Major Problems<\/h3>\n<h4 id=\"problem-1-chronic-absenteeism-crisis-destroying-educational-outcomes\">Problem 1: Chronic Absenteeism Crisis Destroying Educational Outcomes<\/h4>\n<p>38% of JCPS students are chronically absent\u2014missing 10% or more of school days (18+ days annually).

prevent learning:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Poverty and trauma:<\/strong>\n- 60% of JCPS students experience trauma (violence, abuse, housing instability)\n- Students can't learn when hungry, homeless, traumatized, or witnessing violence\n- Social workers and counselors address root causes<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chronic absenteeism:<\/strong>\n- Students missing 10%+ of school days are 36% less likely to graduate\n- Attendance interventions identify barriers and connect families to help\n- Reducing absenteeism improves achievement more than most curriculum reforms<\/p>\n<p><strong>Facility sharing:<\/strong>\n- Reduces duplication (Metro and JCPS both operate recreation facilities)\n- Maximizes community access (schools used evenings\/weekends)\n- Leverages limited capital funds (joint investments)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Partnership benefits both Metro and JCPS:<\/strong>\n- Metro: Better educational outcomes reduce future costs (crime, unemployment, social services)\n- JCPS: Additional

Why should Metro invest in education when JCPS is a separate, independent government entity?<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Because Metro government's success depends on JCPS students' success:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Public safety:<\/strong> Educated youth don't commit crimes; dropouts fill jails. Every percentage point increase in graduation rate reduces violent crime 20%.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Economic development:<\/strong> Companies locate in cities with educated workforces. Talent stays where opportunities exist for young people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health outcomes:<\/strong> Education is the strongest predictor of health\u2014more than income, insurance, or access to care.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Budget impacts:<\/strong> Dropouts cost Metro millions in criminal justice, emergency services, social services. Investing in education SAVES money.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Plus:<\/strong> Metro government has tools JCPS doesn't:\n- After-school programs (Metro Parks, YMCAs, community centers)\n- Youth employment (Metro departments, city contracts)\n- Early childhood (Metro Health, childcare regulation)\n- Social services (housing, health, food assistance that affect learning)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Partnership leverages resources:<\/strong> Metro + JCPS together achieve more than either alone.

When children succeed in school, they escape poverty, avoid the criminal justice system, and contribute to Louisville's prosperity. When children fail, our entire community pays the price.<\/p>\n<p>This comprehensive education and youth development agenda will:\n- Provide 15,000+ students with free, quality after-school programs\n- Create 2,000+ summer jobs and career pathways for youth\n- Triple investment in early childhood education (4,500 pre-K slots)\n- Expand library access with new branches and extended hours\n- Support JCPS students through social workers, counselors, and attendance interventions<\/p>\n<p><strong>Every child deserves excellent education and meaningful opportunities\u2014regardless of zip code, race, or family income.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dave will make Louisville a city that invests in every child's success.<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Related Policy Documents:<\/strong>\n-  Public Safety &amp; Community Policing\n-  Criminal Justice Reform\n-  Health &amp; Human Services\n-  Budget &amp; Financial Management\n-  Affordable Housing &amp; Anti-Displacement\n-  Environmental Justice &amp; Climate Action\n-  Economic Development &amp; Jobs (Employee Bill of Rights)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Learn more at rundaverun.org\/policy<\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>Dave Biggers for Louisville Mayor 2025<\/em>\n<em>\"Democracy that works for everyone.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 id=\"related-policies\">RELATED POLICIES<\/h2>\n<p>This policy works in coordination with these related initiatives:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/policy\/policy-01-public-safety\/\">Public Safety & Community Policing<\/a>:<\/strong> Youth employment and after-school programs prevent violence more cost-effectively than increased policing.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/policy\/policy-02-criminal-justice\/\">Criminal Justice Reform<\/a>:<\/strong> Education support and youth development programs prevent juvenile justice system involvement and break the school-to-prison pipeline.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/policy\/policy-11-technology\/\">Technology & Innovation<\/a>:<\/strong> Universal broadband eliminates the digital divide and tech workforce training creates education-to-career pathways.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/policy\/policy-10-arts-culture\/\">Arts, Culture & Tourism<\/a>:<\/strong> Arts and cultural programming provide essential youth development and creative enrichment opportunities.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"\/policy\/policy-13-neighborhoods\/\">Neighborhood Development<\/a>:<\/strong> Neighborhood infrastructure investments provide safe spaces for youth programs and after-school activities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Explore all 16 comprehensive policies at <a href=\"\/policy\/\">Dave's Complete Policy Platform<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>","post_title":"24.
