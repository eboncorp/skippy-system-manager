  - Proposed mini substation location
  - Local ZIP code
  - Population served
  - Expected response time improvement
- Color-code by implementation phase (Year 1-4)

#### C. Policy Document Enhancement

---

### 2. Campaign Material Integration

#### A. Talking Points Enhancement
**Current:** "At least one in every ZIP code (63 locations)"
**Enhanced:** "63 mini substations covering all Louisville neighborhoods - from Prospect to Valley Station, Shawnee to Jeffersontown"

#### B. Door-to-Door Script
**Addition:**
```
"Your neighborhood [NAME] will have its own mini substation as part of the
63 substations planned across Louisville. Officers will work from right here
in [NEIGHBORHOOD], not from a distant precinct downtown."
```

#### C. Social Media Content
**Sample Posts:**

**Post 1 - Geographic Coverage:**
```
🗺️ 63 mini substations means REAL coverage:
✅ North: Prospect to Indian Hills
✅ East: Middletown to Jeffersontown
✅ South: Okolona to Fairdale
✅ West: Portland to Shawnee
✅ Central: Highlands to Butchertown

Every neighborhood. Every ZIP code. Real community policing.
#RunDaveRun
```

**Post 2 - Satellite Cities:**
```
Did you know Louisville has 83 incorporated cities within Jefferson County?

From tiny Glenview Manor to Jeffersontown, each community deserves
dedicated police presence. That's why we're planning 63 mini substations -
ensuring every neighborhood has officers who know residents by name.

#CommunityPolicing #RunDaveRun
```

**Post 3 - Visual:**
[Attach neighborhoods map]
```
See your neighborhood? It's getting a mini substation.

63 locations across Louisville Metro means officers in YOUR community,
not miles away. 5-minute response times instead of 45 minutes.

This is evidence-based policing that works.
#RunDaveRun
```

2. Neighborhood areas (from map)
3. Satellite cities (from PVA)

**Create Detailed Plan:**
- Priority deployment areas (Year 1)
