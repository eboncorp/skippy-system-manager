<strong>Time:</strong> 3-4 hours  
<strong>Who:</strong> Campaign Manager + Policy Advisor  
<strong>What to Do:</strong></p><p>1. Open: /home/claude/Budget2.5_text/tmp/Budget2.5_text/OPPOSITION_ATTACK_RESPONSES.txt
2. Find/Replace all old budget figures with 3.1 numbers:
   - Old total: $899M → New total: $1.2B
   - Remove all "consolidation savings" references
   - Add "same total as approved budget" everywhere
3. Update key responses:</p><p><strong>"This is defunding the police!"</strong>
OLD: Complex explanation about consolidation  
NEW: "False. My budget has the same total as Mayor the current approved budget - $1.2 billion. Every police officer keeps their job. We're just deploying them smarter - IN neighborhoods, not just responding AFTER crime happens."</p><p><strong>"Where does the money come from?"</strong>
OLD: Consolidation savings  
NEW: "Reallocation within the same $1.2B total. We're not raising taxes or cutting services. We're just shifting money from things that don't work to things proven in 50+ cities."</p><p><strong>"The math doesn't add up!"</strong>
OLD: Complex defense of old budget  
NEW: "Actually, my budget is MORE honest than the current one. Every dollar is accounted for. Here's my detailed appendix showing line-by-line where every dollar goes. Can my opponent show theirs?"</p><p>4. Add new attacks you'll face:
   - "You're inexperienced" → "Fresh eyes, not politics as usual"
   - "This is radical" → "It's evidence-based and proven"
   - "Special interest payback" → "Community-driven, research-backed"</p><p><strong>Resource:</strong> /home/claude/Budget2.5_text/tmp/Budget2.5_text/OPPOSITION_ATTACK_RESPONSES.txt  
<strong>Output:</strong> Updated document, printed copies for debate prep  
<strong>Deadline:</strong> Before first debate/forum</p><p>---</p><h3>☐ TASK 4: Update Door-to-Door Talking Points (URGENT)</h3>
<strong>Time:</strong> 2-3 hours  
<strong>Who:</strong> Field Director + Campaign Manager  
<strong>What to Do:</strong></p><p>1. Open: /home/claude/Budget2.5_text/tmp/Budget2.5_text/DOOR_TO_DOOR_TALKING_POINTS.txt
2. Update all figures for 3.1 budget
3. Simplify to 30-second pitch + 5 key Q&amp;As
4. Add Louisville-specific neighborhoods and stories</p><p><strong>30-Second Pitch:</strong>
"Hi, I'm [name] with Dave Biggers' campaign for mayor. Dave has a plan to make Louisville safer - same budget as the mayor's plan, but smarter. Instead of just responding after crime happens, we'll put police IN neighborhoods with 46 mini substations AND create 18 wellness centers for mental health crises. It's working in 50 other cities. Can Dave count on your support?"</p><p><strong>Top 5 Questions:</strong>
1. "What is a mini substation?" → Small police office in your neighborhood, officers walk the beat, know local residents
2. "What's a wellness center?" → Mental health + addiction professionals for crisis calls, instead of always sending armed police
3. "Will this raise my taxes?" → No. Same $1.2B budget total as current plan
4. "What about violent crime?" → Full police response stays the same, PLUS prevention through community presence
5. "Has this worked anywhere?" → Yes, 50+ cities including [similar city to Louisville]</p><p><strong>Resource:</strong> /home/claude/Budget2.5_text/tmp/Budget2.5_text/DOOR_TO_DOOR_TALKING_POINTS.txt
