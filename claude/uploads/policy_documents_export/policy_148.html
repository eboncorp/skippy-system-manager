✅ <strong>Universal Participation</strong> - Anyone 14+ who lives, works, or goes to school in the district can vote  
✅ <strong>Digital + In-Person</strong> - Vote online, by phone, or at community centers</p><h3>Proven Results</h3><p><strong>New York City:</strong> 706 projects funded, $300+ million invested since 2011

A: <strong>Binding.</strong> If you vote for it, we build it. This is in the official city budget. Your vote directs city staff to implement winning projects.</p><p><strong>Q: What if the city doesn't follow through?</strong>  
A: You can hold us accountable. Every project is tracked online in real-time. The District Council and community oversight committee monitor progress. If projects aren't delivered, vote me out.</p><p><strong>Q: Can the mayor or Metro Council override the results?</strong>
A: No. The $15M is reserved in the budget specifically for participatory budgeting. Once residents vote, the city is legally obligated to implement winning projects (unless they become physically impossible, in which case we'd hold a revote).</p><p><strong>Q: What happens to money not spent?</strong>  
A: Rolled over to next year. Districts can accumulate funds for larger projects if desired.</p><h3>ABOUT ELIGIBILITY</h3><p><strong>Q: Why can 14-year-olds vote? They can't vote in regular elections.</strong>  
A: Research shows youth participatory budgeting increases civic engagement. Young people are stakeholders in their community and often propose creative solutions. Cities with youth PB see higher overall participation.</p><p><strong>Q: I work in District 3 but live in District 4. Which district do I vote in?</strong>  
A: You can vote in <strong>both</strong> if you choose. You have stakes in both communities. Just verify your connection to each.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I just moved to Louisville?</strong>  
A: As soon as you establish residency (lease, utility bill, etc.), you can participate. We want all community members engaged.</p><p><strong>Q: Do undocumented immigrants get to vote?</strong>  
A: Yes. Anyone who lives, works, or goes to school in the district can vote, regardless of immigration status. This is community budgeting, not a federal election.</p><h3>ABOUT PROPOSALS</h3><p><strong>Q: Can I submit more than one proposal?</strong>  
A: Yes, but we encourage working with others on collaborative proposals rather than submitting many individual ideas.</p><p><strong>Q: What if someone already proposed my idea?</strong>  
A: Great! Reach out to them and co-sponsor it. Stronger proposals have multiple community supporters.</p><p><strong>Q: Can nonprofits or businesses submit proposals?</strong>  
A: Yes, but projects must benefit the public, not private entities. A proposal for "public WiFi sponsored by [business]" is fine. A proposal for "renovations to [business] storefront" is not.</p><p><strong>Q: What if my proposal is rejected as infeasible?</strong>  
A: City staff will explain why and offer suggestions to modify it for resubmission. Common issues:
<li>Cost too high → Can we scale down?</li>
<li>Not on city property → Can we find city property nearby?</li>
<li>Requires ongoing costs → Can we redesign it as one-time capital?</li></p><p><strong>Q: Can proposals benefit just one neighborhood, or must they benefit the whole district?</strong>  
A: Neighborhood-specific projects are absolutely fine. That's the point - local people decide local priorities.</p><h3>ABOUT VOTING</h3><p><strong>Q: Is my vote secret?</strong>  
A: Yes. Only aggregate results are published, not individual ballots.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I make a mistake voting online?</strong>  
A: You can change your vote anytime before the deadline (December 15). Just log back in and resubmit.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I have to rank 5 projects?</strong>  
A: No. You can rank just 1 project if that's all you feel strongly about. But ranking more gives you more influence over how the money is spent.</p><p><strong>Q: What stops someone from voting multiple times?</strong>  
A: Verification systems prevent duplicate voting. Each person can only vote once per district. Attempts at fraud are flagged and investigated.</p><h3>ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION</h3><p><strong>Q: How do I know projects are actually getting built?</strong>  
A: Check Digital Democracy Platform anytime. Every project has a page showing current status, budget, timeline, and photos. Updated at least monthly.</p><p><strong>Q: What if a project goes over budget?</strong>  
A: If it's a minor overrun (&lt;10%), we absorb it. If major, we pause the project and return to the community with options: (1) reduce scope, (2) get supplemental funds from another source, or (3) cancel and refund the money.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I volunteer on project implementation?</strong>  
A: In some cases, yes! Community labor can stretch dollars further. For example, volunteers can help with tree planting or painting murals. City staff coordinate volunteers for appropriate projects.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I'm unhappy with a completed project?</strong>  
A: Contact District Council or file complaint via 311. If there are defects, the contractor is responsible for fixing them under warranty.</p><h3>ABOUT THE BIGGER PICTURE</h3><p><strong>Q: Why only $15M? Why not more?</strong>
A: We're starting with a substantial investment to prove the model works at scale. If successful, we can expand further. $15M across 26 districts is significant - more than most cities allocate to participatory budgeting.</p><p><strong>Q: Could this replace the regular budget process?</strong>  
A: No. Most city spending is for essential services (police, fire, roads, salaries) that can't be voted on piecemeal. Participatory budgeting is for discretionary capital projects.</p><p><strong>Q: What about projects that benefit the whole city, not just one district?</strong>  
A: Those go through the regular budget process with Metro Council approval. Participatory budgeting is specifically for neighborhood-scale projects.</p><p><strong>Q: Is this just a gimmick, or is it real democracy?</strong>  
A: It's real democracy. You control the money directly, not through representatives. This gives residents direct power over $15M in public spending - more direct democracy than most Americans ever experience.</p><p>---</p><h2>CONCLUSION: YOUR VOICE, YOUR CHOICE, YOUR COMMUNITY</h2><p>Participatory budgeting is not just about parks and sidewalks - it's about <strong>fundamentally transforming the relationship between residents and government.</strong></p><p><strong>For too long:</strong>
<li>Politicians made decisions behind closed doors</li>
<li>Budgets were incomprehensible documents</li>
<li>Your input was limited to complaints</li>
<li>Power was concentrated at City Hall</li></p><p><strong>Under participatory budgeting:</strong>
✅ YOU propose the projects
✅ YOU debate the priorities
✅ YOU vote directly
✅ YOU hold us accountable</p><p><strong>This is real power. This is real democracy.</strong></p><h3>What This Means for You</h3><p><strong>If you're a parent:</strong>
Your kids can help design the playground they'll actually use.</p><p><strong>If you're a senior:</strong>
You can propose the crosswalk that makes your walk to the grocery store safer.</p><p><strong>If you're a business owner:</strong>
You can advocate for the street improvements that will bring more customers.</p><p><strong>If you're a renter:</strong>
Your voice counts just as much as homeowners.</p><p><strong>If you're an immigrant:</strong>
You belong here, and your perspective matters.</p><p><strong>If you're young:</strong>
You're not too young to have a say. Your future, your voice.</p><h3>The Promise</h3><p><strong>I promise that participatory budgeting will:</strong>
<li>Launch in Year 1 (first vote by December 2026)</li>
<li>Have $15M in the budget every year, guaranteed</li>
<li>Be accessible in multiple languages</li>
<li>Be monitored transparently online</li>
<li>Deliver 90% of projects within 2 years</li>
<li>Expand if successful</li></p><p><strong>And if we fail to deliver?</strong>
Vote me out. It's that simple.</p><p>---</p><p><strong>This is just the beginning.</strong></p><p>Participatory budgeting is one tool in a larger vision: <strong>returning power to Louisville residents.</strong></p><p>Combined with District Councils, the Digital Democracy Platform, and transparent governance, we're building a new kind of city government - one that actually serves you.</p><p><strong>Your voice matters. Your vote counts. Your community wins.</strong></p><p>---</p><p><strong>Questions? Want to get involved?</strong></p><p><strong>Website:</strong> rundaverun.org/participatory-budget
