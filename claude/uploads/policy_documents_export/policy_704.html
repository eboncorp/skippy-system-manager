<h2 id="dave-biggers-for-louisville-mayor-2025">Dave Biggers for Louisville Mayor 2025</h2>
<hr />
<h2 id="executive-summary">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Louisville faces a dual environmental crisis: the immediate health emergency in fence-line communities exposed to industrial pollution, and the long-term threat of climate change already affecting our city through extreme heat, flooding, and air quality decline. These crises disproportionately harm Black and low-income residents—environmental racism that has persisted for generations.</p>
<p>Dave Biggers believes <strong>clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment are fundamental rights</strong>—not privileges reserved for wealthy neighborhoods. While addressing climate change requires federal and state action, Louisville Metro Government has significant power to protect residents from pollution, accelerate clean energy transition, build climate resilience, and ensure environmental benefits reach communities that have suffered environmental harms.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p>Louisville's environmental and climate crisis shows up in devastating statistics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Air Quality Emergency:</strong> Louisville ranks among worst U.S. cities for air pollution. West Louisville residents exposed to industrial emissions at 5-10x rates of East End. Asthma hospitalization rates in West Louisville are 3x citywide average.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rubbertown Pollution:</strong> Chemical Valley (Rubbertown) houses 30+ industrial facilities releasing carcinogens, respiratory toxins, and greenhouse gases into predominantly Black neighborhoods (Shawnee, Chickasaw, Parkway Village).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate Impacts Worsening:</strong> Extreme heat days (&gt;95°F) increased 400% since 1970. Urban heat island effect makes West Louisville 10-15°F hotter than tree-covered East End. Flooding frequency doubled; sewage overflows contaminate waterways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tree Canopy Inequality:</strong> West Louisville has 20% tree canopy coverage; East End has 60%+. Lack of trees increases heat, reduces air quality, and harms mental/physical health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Burden:</strong> Low-income households spend 15-20% of income on utilities (vs. 3% for middle-income)—forcing impossible choices between heating/cooling and food, medicine, rent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="daves-vision">Dave's Vision</h3>
<p>Dave will advance environmental justice and climate action through community-centered policies that prioritize fence-line communities:</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Justice in Rubbertown ($15M annually):</strong> Air monitoring, health studies, pollution reduction enforcement, just transition for workers, community oversight with real power.</p>
<p><strong>Urban Tree Canopy Expansion ($10M annually):</strong> Plant 50,000 trees over 4 years in West Louisville and underserved areas—reducing heat, improving air quality, enhancing health and property values.</p>
<p><strong>Climate Resilience Infrastructure ($8M annually):</strong> Green infrastructure for flooding, extreme heat response, weatherization for low-income homes, emergency preparedness.</p>
<p><strong>Renewable Energy Transition ($5M annually):</strong> Solar on Metro buildings, community solar for low-income residents, electric vehicle fleet conversion, clean energy jobs training.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Transportation ($4M annually):</strong> Protected bike lanes, pedestrian safety improvements, EV charging infrastructure, transit-oriented development.</p>
<h3 id="budget-impact">Budget Impact</h3>
<p>This policy requires <strong>$42 million in new annual spending</strong>—funded through reallocation of economic development incentives to green jobs, federal infrastructure and climate funding, utility partnerships, and carbon offset programs.</p>
<p>All proposals fit within Louisville Metro's $1.2 billion annual general fund budget.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p><strong>Environmental justice is racial justice.</strong> For 70+ years, Louisville zoned polluting industries in Black neighborhoods. Residents didn't choose to live next to chemical plants—racist policy forced them there. Addressing environmental racism isn't optional—it's a moral imperative and legal obligation.</p>
<p><strong>Climate change is here.</strong> Louisville has already experienced 2°F warming; extreme heat, flooding, and severe storms are increasing. Without action, infrastructure will fail, vulnerable residents will suffer, and costs will explode.</p>
<p><strong>Clean energy creates jobs.</strong> Renewable energy and energy efficiency employ more workers per dollar than fossil fuels. Louisville can lead Kentucky's clean energy transition—creating thousands of good-paying jobs while reducing emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Tree canopy is public health infrastructure.</strong> Trees reduce heat (preventing heat stroke), filter air pollution (reducing asthma), manage stormwater (preventing flooding), and improve mental health. Investing in trees is investing in health equity.</p>
<p>Dave's environmental justice and climate action agenda will protect fence-line communities, build climate resilience, accelerate clean energy transition, and ensure Louisville's environmental future benefits everyone—especially those who have suffered environmental harms for generations.</p>

<h3 id="major-problems">Major Problems</h3>
<h4 id="problem-1-rubbertown-environmental-racism-health-crisis">Problem 1: Rubbertown Environmental Racism &amp; Health Crisis</h4>
<p>For over 70 years, Louisville has concentrated polluting industries in a 2-square-mile area called Rubbertown (also known as Chemical Valley)—immediately adjacent to predominantly Black neighborhoods (Shawnee, Chickasaw, Parkway Village, Algonquin).</p>
<p><strong>What's in Rubbertown:</strong>
- 30+ chemical plants, refineries, and industrial facilities
- DuPont, Hexion, Clariant, Koch Industries, others
- Production of synthetic rubber, resins, chemicals, asphalt</p>
<p><strong>What Rubbertown releases:</strong>
- <strong>Carcinogens:</strong> 1,3-butadiene (rubber production byproduct; known human carcinogen)
- <strong>Respiratory toxins:</strong> Sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter
- <strong>Greenhouse gases:</strong> Millions of tons CO2 annually
- <strong>Odors:</strong> Noxious smells residents describe as "rotten eggs," "burning rubber," "chemical stench"</p>
<p><strong>Health impacts on fence-line communities:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cancer:</strong>
- West Louisville cancer risk 60% higher than citywide
- 1,3-butadiene exposure linked to leukemia, lymphoma
- Facilities required to reduce emissions but enforcement weak</p>
<p><strong>Respiratory disease:</strong>
- Asthma hospitalization rate 3x citywide average
- COPD prevalence 2x citywide average
- Children miss school due to respiratory illness at twice the rate</p>
<p><strong>Cardiovascular disease:</strong>
- Air pollution linked to heart attacks, strokes, hypertension
- West Louisville cardiovascular mortality 40% higher than East End</p>
<p><strong>Birth outcomes:</strong>
- Low birth weight 50% more common
- Preterm birth rates elevated
- Developmental issues in children exposed to toxins</p>
<p><strong>Quality of life:</strong>
- Residents can't open windows on hot days (odors, pollution)
- Children can't play outside when air quality poor
- Property values depressed (who wants to live next to chemical plants?)
- Constant fear about long-term health effects</p>
<p><strong>This is environmental racism:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Historical zoning:</strong> Louisville deliberately zoned heavy industry in Black neighborhoods (1920s-1960s)</li>
<li><strong>Residential segregation:</strong> Redlining confined Black families to West Louisville; couldn't move away</li>
<li><strong>Political powerlessness:</strong> Fence-line communities lack political power to force cleanup</li>
<li><strong>Continued siting:</strong> New polluting facilities still located near existing pollution (cumulative impacts ignored)</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate enforcement:</strong> Violations occur; fines are minimal; companies continue polluting</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Current response is inadequate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District (APCD):</strong> Underfunded, understaffed, industry-friendly</li>
<li><strong>Air monitoring:</strong> Only 6 monitors citywide; gaps in fence-line communities</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement:</strong> Rarely shuts down facilities for violations; fines too small to deter</li>
<li><strong>Health studies:</strong> Limited tracking of long-term health impacts</li>
<li><strong>Community input:</strong> Residents excluded from permit decisions</li>
<li><strong>Just transition:</strong> No plan to support workers if facilities close or transition</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Generations of Black residents exposed to toxic pollution, suffering premature death and disease, while companies profit and government fails to protect public health.</p>
<h4 id="problem-2-climate-change-impacts-hitting-louisville-now">Problem 2: Climate Change Impacts Hitting Louisville Now</h4>
<p>Climate change isn't a future threat—it's harming Louisville today, with impacts worsening:</p>
<p><strong>Extreme Heat:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase:</strong> Extreme heat days (&gt;95°F) increased from 5/year (1970s) to 25/year (2020s)</li>
<li><strong>Projection:</strong> Will reach 45+ days/year by 2050 without action</li>
<li><strong>Health impacts:</strong> Heat stroke, heart attacks, respiratory distress; 200+ deaths during 2023 heat wave</li>
<li><strong>Vulnerable populations:</strong> Elderly, outdoor workers, people without AC, people with chronic illness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Urban Heat Island Effect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disparity:</strong> West Louisville 10-15°F hotter than tree-covered East End on summer days</li>
<li><strong>Cause:</strong> Lack of tree canopy, abundance of asphalt/concrete, industrial heat emissions</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Poor and Black residents suffer most from extreme heat</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure stress:</strong> Power grid strain; roads buckle; water systems stressed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Flooding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Major flooding events doubled since 1990</li>
<li><strong>Causes:</strong> More intense rainfall (climate change), impervious surfaces, inadequate stormwater infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Impacts:</strong> Property damage, basement flooding, road closures, combined sewer overflows</li>
<li><strong>Sewage contamination:</strong> 7 billion gallons untreated sewage overflow annually into Ohio River, Beargrass Creek</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Air Quality Decline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ozone:</strong> Heat and pollution create ground-level ozone (smog); unhealthy air quality days increasing</li>
<li><strong>Particulate matter:</strong> Wildfires (climate-driven) degrade Louisville air quality</li>
<li><strong>Health:</strong> Asthma attacks, emergency room visits, respiratory hospitalizations increase on poor air quality days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economic Costs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure damage:</strong> Roads, bridges, stormwater systems degrading faster</li>
<li><strong>Energy costs:</strong> Cooling costs rising as extreme heat increases</li>
<li><strong>Health costs:</strong> Heat-related illness, air pollution disease</li>
<li><strong>Lost productivity:</strong> Workers less productive in extreme heat; outdoor work dangerous</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Current response failing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No comprehensive climate action plan:</strong> Louisville lacks enforceable emissions reduction targets, adaptation strategy</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient green infrastructure:</strong> Stormwater management still relies on gray infrastructure (pipes, basins)</li>
<li><strong>Inadequate emergency response:</strong> Heat warning systems exist but insufficient cooling centers, outreach to vulnerable residents</li>
<li><strong>Fossil fuel dependence:</strong> 95%+ of Metro energy from fossil fuels; no renewable transition plan</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Climate impacts intensifying, vulnerable residents suffering, infrastructure failing, costs mounting—while Louisville lacks coordinated response.</p>
<h4 id="problem-3-tree-canopy-inequality-creating-health-heat-disparities">Problem 3: Tree Canopy Inequality Creating Health &amp; Heat Disparities</h4>
<p>Louisville has massive tree canopy inequality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>West Louisville:</strong> 20% tree canopy</li>
<li><strong>East End:</strong> 60%+ tree canopy</li>
<li><strong>Citywide average:</strong> 42%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This isn't natural—it's the result of policy choices and disinvestment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why tree canopy matters:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heat reduction:</strong>
- Trees provide shade; reduce surface temperatures 10-20°F
- Neighborhoods with low tree canopy experience dangerous heat
- Heat stroke, heart attacks, respiratory distress concentrated in low-canopy areas</p>
<p><strong>Air quality:</strong>
- Trees filter particulate matter, absorb ozone precursors
- Low-canopy neighborhoods have worse air quality
- Asthma and respiratory disease concentrated in areas with few trees</p>
<p><strong>Mental health:</strong>
- Access to trees reduces stress, depression, anxiety
- "Nature deficit" linked to behavioral problems in children
- Low-canopy neighborhoods have worse mental health outcomes</p>
<p><strong>Property values:</strong>
- Tree-lined streets increase property values 10-15%
- Low-canopy neighborhoods have depressed values
- Wealth gap perpetuated by tree canopy inequality</p>
<p><strong>Stormwater management:</strong>
- Trees absorb rainfall, reduce runoff, prevent flooding
- Low-canopy neighborhoods flood more frequently
- Green infrastructure cheaper than gray infrastructure</p>
<p><strong>Why inequality exists:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Historical disinvestment:</strong> West Louisville received no tree planting, park development for decades</li>
<li><strong>Urban renewal:</strong> Highways, public housing demolished trees; never replanted</li>
<li><strong>Lack of maintenance:</strong> Trees planted but not watered, pruned; died from neglect</li>
<li><strong>Private property:</strong> East End homeowners plant/maintain trees; low-income residents can't afford</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Current tree planting insufficient:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Louisville plants 3,000-5,000 trees annually (mix of public and private land)</li>
<li>Need to plant 10,000-15,000 annually to close canopy gap in reasonable timeframe</li>
<li>Planting concentrated in East End, parks—not fence-line communities needing trees most</li>
<li>Maintenance lacking; 30-40% of planted trees die within 5 years</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Tree canopy inequality perpetuates health disparities, heat inequality, and the racial wealth gap.</p>
<h4 id="problem-4-energy-burden-crushing-low-income-families">Problem 4: Energy Burden Crushing Low-Income Families</h4>
<p>Low-income Louisville households spend 15-20% of income on utilities (electricity, gas, water); middle-income households spend 3%. This "energy burden" forces impossible choices:</p>
<p><strong>Energy or food:</strong>
- Families skip meals to pay utility bills
- Children hungry because energy costs consume food budget</p>
<p><strong>Energy or medicine:</strong>
- Seniors choose between heating/cooling and prescription medications
- Chronic conditions worsen when patients can't afford both utilities and healthcare</p>
<p><strong>Energy or housing:</strong>
- Families face eviction when utility costs push total housing costs beyond 50% of income
- Utility shut-offs common (15,000+ annually in Louisville)</p>
<p><strong>Health consequences:</strong>
- <strong>Summer:</strong> People without AC suffer heat stroke during extreme heat
- <strong>Winter:</strong> People without heat suffer hypothermia, respiratory illness
- <strong>Year-round:</strong> Stress of energy insecurity harms mental and physical health</p>
<p><strong>Why energy burden is so high:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inefficient housing:</strong> Low-income residents live in old, poorly insulated housing; energy leaks out</li>
<li><strong>Old appliances:</strong> Can't afford efficient refrigerators, water heaters, HVAC; pay more to run inefficient equipment</li>
<li><strong>Inability to invest:</strong> Can't afford upfront costs of weatherization, efficiency upgrades</li>
<li><strong>Utility rate structure:</strong> Fixed charges and declining block rates favor high-volume users (punish low-income conservation)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Current assistance inadequate:</strong></p>
<p><strong>LIHEAP (Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program):</strong>
- Federal program providing utility bill assistance
- Serves only 15-20% of eligible households (underfunded)
- One-time annual payment ($300-500)—doesn't address long-term burden</p>
<p><strong>Weatherization Assistance Program:</strong>
- Federal program providing free weatherization (insulation, air sealing, furnace replacement)
- Waitlist 2-3 years
- Serves 500 homes annually (need is 50,000+)</p>
<p><strong>Utility company programs:</strong>
- LG&amp;E offers bill payment plans, crisis assistance
- But doesn't address root cause: inefficient housing</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Low-income families trapped in energy poverty—spending huge portions of income on utilities, suffering health consequences, unable to escape cycle.</p>
<h4 id="problem-5-louisvilles-greenhouse-gas-emissions-excessive-no-transition-plan">Problem 5: Louisville's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Excessive, No Transition Plan</h4>
<p>Louisville emits 16 million metric tons of CO2e annually—22 tons per capita, 38% higher than U.S. average.</p>
<p><strong>Emissions sources:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Electricity (40%):</strong> Coal and natural gas power plants</li>
<li><strong>Transportation (30%):</strong> Cars, trucks (Louisville is car-dependent)</li>
<li><strong>Industry (20%):</strong> Rubbertown chemical plants, manufacturing</li>
<li><strong>Buildings (10%):</strong> Heating, cooling, appliances in homes and businesses</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Louisville lacks enforceable climate action plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2013 Climate Action Plan set goals but no binding targets</li>
<li>No emissions reduction mandates</li>
<li>No timeline for fossil fuel phase-out</li>
<li>No accountability mechanism</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Renewable energy adoption minimal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Louisville Metro buildings: &lt;5% renewable electricity</li>
<li>Residential solar: &lt;1% of homes</li>
<li>No community solar (low-income residents can't access solar benefits)</li>
<li>No municipal utility (can't control energy sources)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transportation emissions unaddressed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Louisville remains car-dependent (sprawl, inadequate transit)</li>
<li>Electric vehicle adoption low (&lt;2% of vehicles)</li>
<li>EV charging infrastructure minimal (100 public chargers for metro area of 1.3M)</li>
<li>No incentives for EV purchase, home charger installation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Louisville contributes disproportionately to climate crisis while failing to transition to clean energy—missing job creation opportunities, harming public health, increasing long-term costs.</p>
<h3 id="why-current-system-persists">Why Current System Persists</h3>
<p>Six factors maintain the status quo:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Industry political power:</strong> Chemical companies, utilities, fossil fuel interests lobby against regulation</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory capture:</strong> Air Pollution Control District influenced by industries it regulates</li>
<li><strong>Fragmented authority:</strong> Climate and environment span multiple agencies; no coordinated strategy</li>
<li><strong>Racism and classism:</strong> Affluent white residents insulated from pollution; lack urgency for environmental justice</li>
<li><strong>Short-term thinking:</strong> Politicians prioritize visible projects over long-term climate resilience</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient funding:</strong> Metro invests &lt;$5M annually in environmental programs; peer cities invest $30-100M</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Without major policy intervention, environmental racism will persist, climate impacts will worsen, and Louisville will fall further behind on clean energy transition.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Biggers will change course.</strong></p>

<h3 id="proposal-5-sustainable-transportation-4m-annually">Proposal 5: Sustainable Transportation ($4M Annually)</h3>
<h4 id="what-it-is_4">What It Is</h4>
<p>Louisville will build sustainable transportation infrastructure through protected bike lanes, pedestrian safety improvements, EV charging, and transit-oriented development.</p>
<p><strong>Four Strategies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strategy 1: Protected Bike Lane Network ($2M annually)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Current:</strong> Louisville has 100 miles of bike lanes; most are unprotected (painted lines on roads); usage low due to safety concerns</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> 50 miles of protected bike lanes over 4 years (12-15 miles annually)</p>
<p><strong>Protected bike lanes:</strong>
- Physical barriers (curbs, bollards, planters) separating bikes from cars
- Proven to increase ridership 200-400% (safety attracts riders)
- Lower speeds, reduce crashes</p>
<p><strong>Priority corridors:</strong>
1. <strong>West Louisville to downtown:</strong> Broadway, Market Street (connect Russell, Shawnee to jobs downtown)
2. <strong>South End to downtown:</strong> Preston Highway, 3rd Street (connect Newburg, Highview)
3. <strong>University connections:</strong> Connect UofL, Bellarmine, community colleges
4. <strong>Parks and trails:</strong> Connect Olmsted Parks, Louisville Loop</p>
<p><strong>Design standards:</strong>
- Protected separation (not just paint)
- Intersection protection (most dangerous locations)
- Green infrastructure integration (bioswales alongside bike lanes)
- Lighting (safety for evening riders)</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong>
- Increased ridership (200-400% on protected routes)
- Reduced car trips (climate, air quality, congestion)
- Health (physical activity, reduced obesity/diabetes)
- Equity (low-income residents often bike for transportation, not recreation)
- Economic development (bike-friendly cities attract young talent)</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 2: Pedestrian Safety Improvements ($1M annually)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Louisville has high pedestrian fatality rate (2-3x national average); concentrated in West Louisville, South End</p>
<p><strong>Improvements (100 locations annually):</strong>
1. <strong>Crosswalk upgrades:</strong> High-visibility markings, rapid-flash beacons, curb extensions
2. <strong>Traffic calming:</strong> Speed humps, curb extensions, road diets (reduce lanes to slow speeds)
3. <strong>Sidewalk completion:</strong> Fill gaps in sidewalk network (many West Louisville streets lack sidewalks)
4. <strong>Lighting:</strong> Improve visibility at crosswalks, bus stops</p>
<p><strong>Priority areas:</strong>
- High pedestrian crash corridors (Broadway, Dixie Highway, Preston Highway)
- Schools (safe routes to school)
- Transit stops (bus riders are pedestrians)
- Low-income neighborhoods (residents walk more; infrastructure worse)</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong>
- Pedestrian fatalities reduced 40-60%
- Walkability improved (more residents can walk safely)
- Transit ridership increased (easier to access bus stops)
- Equity (low-income residents depend on walking; wealthy residents drive)</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 3: EV Charging Infrastructure ($500K annually)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Louisville has 100 public EV chargers for metro area of 1.3M; inadequate for EV adoption</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Install 200 public EV chargers over 4 years (50 annually)</p>
<p><strong>Locations:</strong>
- Metro facilities (libraries, community centers, parks)
- Park-and-rides
- Commercial corridors (encourage businesses to add chargers)
- Equity focus (chargers in West Louisville, South End)</p>
<p><strong>Charger types:</strong>
- Level 2 chargers (4-6 hour full charge; overnight parking)
- DC fast chargers (30-minute charge; major corridors)</p>
<p><strong>Funding:</strong>
- Metro investment: $500K annually
- Federal Infrastructure Act (EV charging): $500K (requires local match)
- Private sector (businesses install chargers with incentives): $500K
- Total investment: $1.5M annually (Metro $500K leverages $1M additional)</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong>
- Supports EV adoption (range anxiety reduced)
- Air quality improvement (EVs have zero tailpipe emissions)
- Equity (low-income residents can charge at public locations if can't install home chargers)</p>
<p><strong>Strategy 4: Transit-Oriented Development Incentives ($500K annually)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Louisville's sprawl creates car dependence; transit ridership low</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Incentivize dense, walkable development near transit</p>
<p><strong>Incentives for developers:</strong>
- <strong>Density bonuses:</strong> Build more units if near transit (affordable housing requirement)
- <strong>Fast-track permitting:</strong> Expedited approvals for transit-oriented projects
- <strong>Fee waivers:</strong> Reduce impact fees for car-lite developments
- <strong>Infrastructure support:</strong> Metro invests in sidewalks, bike lanes, streetscape near developments</p>
<p><strong>Criteria:</strong>
- Within 1/4 mile of high-frequency bus route or future rapid transit
- Mixed-use (residential + retail/office)
- Minimum 15% affordable housing
- Pedestrian-friendly design (buildings close to street, wide sidewalks, activated ground floors)</p>
<p><strong>Funding:</strong>
- Metro investment: $500K annually (infrastructure, planning support)
- Leverages private development ($50-100M in private investment annually)</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong>
- Increased transit ridership (residents near transit use it)
- Reduced car trips (walkable neighborhoods)
- Affordable housing (density + transit access)
- Economic development (compact development more efficient)</p>
<h4 id="why-it-matters_4">Why It Matters</h4>
<p><strong>Transportation is Louisville's largest source of emissions (30% of total)—and most inequitable:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bike lanes:</strong>
- Reduce car trips (climate, air quality)
- Provide affordable transportation (bikes cheaper than cars)
- Health benefits (physical activity)
- Safety (protected lanes reduce crashes 90%)</p>
<p><strong>Pedestrian safety:</strong>
- Saves lives (pedestrian fatalities reduced 40-60%)
- Equity (low-income residents walk more)
- Supports transit (walkability and transit are complementary)</p>
<p><strong>EV charging:</strong>
- Accelerates EV adoption (addresses range anxiety)
- Reduces emissions (transportation is 30% of Louisville's carbon footprint)
- Equity (public chargers provide access for renters, multifamily residents)</p>
<p><strong>Transit-oriented development:</strong>
- Reduces sprawl (environmental and fiscal benefits)
- Increases transit ridership (makes transit viable)
- Affordable housing (density near transit)</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong>
- <strong>Portland, OR:</strong> Protected bike lanes increased ridership 400%; bike mode share 7% (vs. 1% Louisville)
- <strong>Seattle:</strong> Pedestrian safety improvements reduced fatalities 50%
- <strong>Denver:</strong> Transit-oriented development increased transit ridership 35%, reduced VMT (vehicle miles traveled) 20%</p>
<h4 id="budget_4">Budget</h4>
<p><strong>Annual Cost:</strong> $4 million</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown:</strong>
- Protected bike lanes: $2M (12-15 miles annually)
- Pedestrian safety improvements: $1M (100 locations)
- EV charging infrastructure: $500K (leverages $1M total with federal/private)
- Transit-oriented development incentives: $500K</p>
<p><strong>Funding Sources:</strong>
- Metro general fund: $2.5M
- Federal Infrastructure Act (transportation): $1M
- Private sector (EV chargers, TOD): $500K</p>
<p><strong>Cost-Benefit:</strong>
- Transportation emissions reduced 10% by Year 4
- Pedestrian fatalities reduced 40-50%
- Economic development (bike/walk-friendly cities attract talent and businesses)
- Health savings (physical activity reduces obesity, diabetes, heart disease)
- Return: $3-5 per $1 invested</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
<h3 id="1-why-should-louisville-prioritize-environmental-justice-when-we-have-urgent-problems-like-crime-and-poverty">1. Why should Louisville prioritize environmental justice when we have urgent problems like crime and poverty?</h3>
<p><strong>Environmental racism IS a crime and poverty issue:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crime connection:</strong>
- Pollution harms children's brain development → behavioral problems → school failure → justice system involvement
- Lead exposure (from industrial pollution) increases violent crime 400%
- Community disinvestment (pollution decreases property values) → economic desperation → crime</p>
<p><strong>Poverty connection:</strong>
- Pollution causes illness → medical bills, lost work → deeper poverty
- Energy burden (inefficient housing) → 15-20% of income on utilities → less for food, medicine, rent
- Decreased property values (who wants to live near chemical plants?) → can't build wealth</p>
<p><strong>Health costs:</strong>
- West Louisville residents hospitalized for asthma at 3x citywide rate → emergency room visits cost Metro millions
- Cancer from pollution exposure → treatment costs, premature death, lost productivity
- Every dollar invested in pollution reduction saves $3-5 in healthcare costs</p>
<p><strong>Environmental justice doesn't compete with other priorities—it addresses root causes of crime, poverty, and health disparities.</strong></p>
<h3 id="2-wont-strict-pollution-enforcement-in-rubbertown-cause-facilities-to-close-and-workers-to-lose-jobs">2. Won't strict pollution enforcement in Rubbertown cause facilities to close and workers to lose jobs?</h3>
<p><strong>No—if we do just transition right:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pollution reduction ≠ facility closure:</strong>
- Facilities can reduce emissions through technology upgrades (scrubbers, leak detection, process improvements)
- Companies profitable; can afford investments
- Many violations are from neglect (poor maintenance), not inherent to production
- Enforcement creates level playing field (companies that follow rules aren't undercut by polluters)</p>
<p><strong>IF facilities do close:</strong>
- Workers receive income support (80% wage replacement up to 2 years)
- Retraining for clean economy jobs (solar, energy efficiency, EV technicians)
- Hiring preferences for Metro jobs, local businesses
- Many chemical workers have transferable skills (process control, maintenance, safety) applicable to clean industries</p>
<p><strong>Clean economy creates MORE jobs:</strong>
- Renewable energy employs 3x more workers per dollar than fossil fuels
- Energy efficiency is labor-intensive (installation, maintenance)
- 800+ clean energy jobs created through Dave's programs</p>
<p><strong>Evidence from other cities:</strong>
- Richmond, CA: Refinery pollution reduction requirements → technology upgrades, not closure; 150 clean tech jobs created
- Just transition programs (coal communities): 85% of workers retained income levels after retraining</p>
<p><strong>We can protect workers AND communities—they're not in conflict.</strong></p>
<h3 id="3-will-planting-trees-really-make-a-measurable-difference-in-temperature-and-air-quality-or-is-this-just-feel-good-environmentalism">3. Will planting trees really make a measurable difference in temperature and air quality, or is this just feel-good environmentalism?</h3>
<p><strong>Trees make MASSIVE, scientifically documented differences:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Temperature reduction:</strong>
- Large tree shades 1,500 sq ft, reduces surface temperatures 10-20°F
- Evapotranspiration (water release from leaves) cools air like natural AC
- Philadelphia study: 10,000 trees reduced neighborhood temperatures 3-5°F
- Louisville's 50,000 trees will reduce West Louisville summer temps 3-5°F—preventing heat stroke, reducing cooling costs</p>
<p><strong>Air quality improvement:</strong>
- One large tree removes 50 lbs of air pollution annually (particulate matter, ozone precursors)
- 50,000 trees = 2.5 million lbs of pollution filtered over 30 years
- Louisville research (Nature Conservancy): Tree planting in West Louisville would reduce PM2.5 by 10%—preventing 50+ premature deaths annually</p>
<p><strong>Stormwater management:</strong>
- Large tree intercepts 2,000+ gallons rainfall annually
- 50,000 trees = 100 million gallons absorbed over 30 years
- Reduces flooding, sewer overflows</p>
<p><strong>Property values:</strong>
- Tree-lined streets increase property values 10-15%
- 50,000 trees in West Louisville would increase property values $25-50M</p>
<p><strong>This isn't feel-good—it's evidence-based public health infrastructure.</strong></p>
<h3 id="4-how-can-louisville-transition-to-renewable-energy-when-we-dont-control-the-utility-lge-is-private">4. How can Louisville transition to renewable energy when we don't control the utility (LG&amp;E is private)?</h3>
<p><strong>True, Louisville doesn't own the utility—but we have significant power:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Metro CAN control:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Metro government electricity purchases:</strong></li>
<li>Louisville Metro is large customer (thousands of accounts)</li>
<li>Can demand renewable energy through power purchase agreements</li>
<li>
<p>Solar on Metro buildings generates our own power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community solar:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Metro partners with solar developers to build solar farms</li>
<li>Residents subscribe; receive bill credits</li>
<li>
<p>No utility ownership required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building codes:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Require solar-ready roofs on new construction (wiring, structural capacity)</li>
<li>Require energy efficiency in buildings</li>
<li>
<p>Electric vehicle charging infrastructure in new developments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incentives:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Property tax breaks for solar installations</li>
<li>Expedited permitting for renewable energy projects</li>
<li>
<p>Grant programs for low-income solar access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Electric vehicle adoption:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Convert Metro fleet to EVs</li>
<li>Install public EV charging</li>
<li>Reduce transportation emissions (30% of Louisville's carbon footprint)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What we CANNOT control (but can advocate for):</strong>
- LG&amp;E's generation mix (state Public Service Commission regulates)
- Retail electricity rates
- Investor-owned utility structure</p>
<p><strong>But Metro has enormous influence:</strong>
- Louisville is LG&amp;E's largest customer base
- Political pressure (mayor can advocate to PSC)
- Demonstration effect (Metro solar shows viability)</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong>
- Indianapolis (also private utility): City installed solar on 200 buildings, created community solar, converted fleet to EVs—all without owning utility
- Kansas City: 50% renewable electricity goal by 2030 using same tools</p>
<p><strong>We can't control everything—but we can control enough to make major progress.</strong></p>
<h3 id="5-wont-weatherizing-low-income-homes-just-be-a-giveaway-that-benefits-landlords-more-than-tenants">5. Won't weatherizing low-income homes just be a giveaway that benefits landlords more than tenants?</h3>
<p><strong>No—program design prevents this:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tenant protections:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rent stabilization requirement:</strong></li>
<li>Landlords receiving weatherization cannot raise rent for 5 years</li>
<li>Lease requirement (enforced by Metro)</li>
<li>
<p>Violators pay back full weatherization cost + penalties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Priority for owner-occupied homes:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>60% of weatherization for homeowners (low-income seniors, families)</li>
<li>
<p>Homeowners directly benefit from energy savings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tenant-occupied eligibility:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Landlords qualify IF they serve low-income tenants (&lt;80% AMI)</li>
<li>AND agree to 5-year rent stabilization</li>
<li>
<p>AND provide 5-year lease to current tenants (no displacement)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Payback to tenants:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>If landlord sells building within 5 years, must pay tenants share of energy savings</li>
<li>Ensures tenants benefit even if landlord exits</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tenant benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced utility bills (30-40% savings)</li>
<li>Improved comfort (warmer in winter, cooler in summer)</li>
<li>Better health (less mold, improved air quality)</li>
<li>Housing stability (5-year lease protection)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Homeowner benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced utility bills (frees up $600-800 annually)</li>
<li>Increased property value (efficiency upgrades)</li>
<li>Improved comfort and health</li>
<li>No upfront cost (100% free)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong>
- Federal Weatherization Program: 60% of participants are homeowners; 40% renters with rent stabilization protections
- Studies show tenants receive 80%+ of energy savings when rent stabilization enforced</p>
<p><strong>This benefits tenants directly—and prevents landlord windfalls through strong protections.</strong></p>
<h3 id="6-isnt-climate-change-a-global-problem-that-louisville-alone-cant-solve-why-should-we-spend-millions-when-china-and-india-are-the-real-polluters">6. Isn't climate change a global problem that Louisville alone can't solve? Why should we spend millions when China and India are the real polluters?</h3>
<p><strong>Three responses:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Response 1: Louisville residents are suffering climate impacts NOW:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>200+ heat deaths in 2023 heat wave</li>
<li>Flooding doubled; $50M+ in property damage annually</li>
<li>Air quality decline; asthma hospitalizations increasing</li>
<li>Infrastructure failing (roads buckling, water systems stressed)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Climate resilience isn't about saving the world—it's about protecting Louisville residents.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Response 2: Louisville's emissions are excessive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>22 tons CO2 per capita (vs. 16 tons U.S. average, 4 tons global average)</li>
<li>16 million tons total annually</li>
<li>We bear responsibility for our disproportionate contribution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Response 3: Clean energy creates jobs and saves money:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Renewable energy employs 3x more workers per dollar than fossil fuels</li>
<li>Energy efficiency reduces costs (saves low-income households $600-800 annually)</li>
<li>Solar electricity cheaper than grid power long-term</li>
<li>Early adopters gain competitive advantage (attract businesses, talent)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Waiting for others to act is a recipe for catastrophe:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Tragedy of the commons" argument ("Why should I act if others don't?") ensures NO ONE acts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leadership approach ("We'll show it's possible"):</strong>
- Louisville demonstrates climate action is economically beneficial
- Other cities follow (peer city competition)
- Collective action emerges from leadership</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong>
- 500+ U.S. cities committed to Paris Agreement climate goals after federal withdrawal
- Cities account for 70% of global emissions—local action IS global action
- Early adopter cities (Portland, San Francisco, Seattle) have stronger economies, attract talent</p>
<p><strong>Louisville can lead—or fall behind as other cities build clean economy while we cling to fossil fuels.</strong></p>
<h3 id="7-wont-installing-protected-bike-lanes-reduce-parking-and-hurt-businesses">7. Won't installing protected bike lanes reduce parking and hurt businesses?</h3>
<p><strong>No—evidence shows protected bike lanes INCREASE business revenue:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parking myth:</strong>
- Studies show customers overestimate importance of parking
- Most retail customers (60-70%) walk, bike, or take transit—don't drive
- Bike lanes increase foot traffic → more customers</p>
<p><strong>Revenue reality:</strong></p>
<p><strong>New York City study:</strong>
- Retail sales increased 50% on streets with protected bike lanes (vs. 3% citywide)
- Cyclists and pedestrians visit more frequently, spend more monthly (smaller purchases but more trips)</p>
<p><strong>Portland, OR:</strong>
- Businesses on bike lanes saw 20% revenue increase vs. 7% citywide</p>
<p><strong>Louisville can learn:</strong>
- Prioritize bike lanes on commercial corridors (Broadway, Bardstown Road, Frankfort Avenue)
- Design with community input (businesses help plan)
- Provide bike parking (corrals replacing 1-2 car spaces = 10-20 bike spaces)</p>
<p><strong>Plus: Parking utilization data shows abundance:</strong>
- Most Louisville commercial corridors have &lt;60% parking utilization (ample supply)
- Removing 10-20 spaces for bike lane doesn't create shortage</p>
<p><strong>If parking truly concerns businesses:</strong>
- Shared parking agreements (businesses share lots)
- Residential permit parking (prevents employees taking customer spots)
- Parking behind buildings (not on main street—improves walkability)</p>
<p><strong>Protected bike lanes make streets safer, more vibrant, more economically successful.</strong></p>
<h3 id="8-how-will-you-ensure-environmental-justice-policies-actually-benefit-fence-line-communities-and-arent-just-greenwashing">8. How will you ensure environmental justice policies actually benefit fence-line communities and aren't just greenwashing?</h3>
<p><strong>Four accountability mechanisms:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mechanism 1: Community Environmental Justice Board with REAL POWER:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 of 15 board members are fence-line residents (elected by community)</li>
<li>Board VOTES on permits (Metro cannot approve permits Board rejects)</li>
<li>Board directs enforcement priorities</li>
<li>Board controls $500K annual budget</li>
<li>Not "advisory"—actual decision-making authority</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanism 2: Transparent, real-time data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>20 air monitors in fence-line communities</li>
<li>Data published publicly in real-time (no hiding)</li>
<li>Community scientists trained to interpret data</li>
<li>Monthly community meetings presenting findings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanism 3: Health study independent oversight:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Community representatives on health study steering committee</li>
<li>Veto power over study design (ensures serves residents, not industry)</li>
<li>Results public; accessible to community</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mechanism 4: Enforcement accountability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Violation reports public within 24 hours</li>
<li>Community can request specific enforcement actions</li>
<li>Board reviews all enforcement decisions</li>
<li>Penalties paid to community (health services, home filtration)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plus: Legal protections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental justice ordinance (not just executive order—can't be reversed by future mayor)</li>
<li>Private right of action (residents can sue polluters directly)</li>
<li>Attorney General partnership (state-level enforcement backup)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence from other cities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Richmond, CA: Community board forced refinery to reduce emissions 40%; vetoed expansion permit</li>
<li>Houston: Community monitoring detected cancer cluster; forced facility closure</li>
<li>Community power works when it's REAL power—not just "input" that's ignored</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dave will ensure fence-line communities control their environmental future.</strong></p>
<h3 id="9-what-happens-to-these-environmental-programs-after-daves-term-ends-can-the-next-mayor-undo-everything">9. What happens to these environmental programs after Dave's term ends? Can the next mayor undo everything?</h3>
<p><strong>Dave will institutionalize environmental justice and climate action so they outlast his administration:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Legal infrastructure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ordinances (not executive orders):</strong></li>
<li>Environmental Justice Board established by Metro Council ordinance</li>
<li>Tree canopy goals codified in Urban Forestry Master Plan (Metro Council adopted)</li>
<li>Climate action targets in enforceable Climate Adaptation Plan</li>
<li>
<p>Future mayor cannot undo without Metro Council vote</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Funding mechanisms:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Green infrastructure fund (dedicated revenue from stormwater fees)</li>
<li>Tree planting fund (developers required to contribute)</li>
<li>Renewable energy fund (power purchase agreements lock in long-term commitments)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Political sustainability:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Constituency:</strong></li>
<li>Fence-line communities with decision-making power defend Environmental Justice Board</li>
<li>800+ clean energy workers defend job training programs</li>
<li>10,000 weatherized households defend energy efficiency</li>
<li>
<p>2,000 community solar subscribers defend renewable energy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Demonstrated results:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>When pollution drops 25%, health improves, trees cool neighborhoods, clean energy saves money—success undeniable</li>
<li>Future mayor faces political cost of reversing effective programs</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Institutional partnerships:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>University partnerships:</strong></li>
<li>UofL School of Public Health conducts health study (10-year commitment)</li>
<li>
<p>Long-term research programs survive mayoral transitions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Federal funding:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once established, federal climate/infrastructure grants continue (renewable 5-year cycles)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Utility agreements:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Power purchase agreements for solar (15-20 year contracts)</li>
<li>Community solar (25-year developer agreements)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>National recognition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Louisville becomes environmental justice leader</li>
<li>Reputational incentives maintain programs (cities compete for "greenest city" status)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once infrastructure is built—air monitors, tree planting workforce, solar on buildings, green stormwater systems—it's politically and practically difficult to dismantle.</strong></p>
<h3 id="10-why-focus-on-trees-and-green-infrastructure-when-we-need-jobs-and-economic-development">10. Why focus on trees and green infrastructure when we need jobs and economic development?</h3>
<p><strong>Trees and green infrastructure ARE economic development:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Job creation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tree planting/maintenance:</strong> 40 full-time workers ($18/hour = $1.4M annual wages)</li>
<li><strong>Green infrastructure construction:</strong> 200 jobs (construction, landscaping, engineering)</li>
<li><strong>Clean energy:</strong> 800 workers trained for renewable energy, energy efficiency, EV jobs ($50K average salary = $40M annual wages)</li>
<li><strong>Total:</strong> 1,000+ jobs created</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cost savings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green infrastructure:</strong> Saves $2 billion in gray infrastructure costs (sewer separation)</li>
<li><strong>Weatherization:</strong> Saves low-income households $6-8M annually (frees up income for local spending)</li>
<li><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Saves Metro $500K annually in electricity costs</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare savings:</strong> Reduced pollution, heat deaths, asthma saves $20-50M annually in healthcare costs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economic development advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talent attraction:</strong> Young professionals choose cities with environmental quality</li>
<li><strong>Business location:</strong> Companies consider environmental sustainability, climate resilience</li>
<li><strong>Property values:</strong> Tree-lined streets, green infrastructure increase values 10-15%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Philadelphia green infrastructure:</strong> $2.4B investment creates 4,000 jobs; avoids $9.6B gray infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Portland tree planting:</strong> $30M investment creates 250 jobs, increases property values $100M</li>
<li><strong>Clean energy nationally:</strong> 3.2 million jobs; fastest-growing sector</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Traditional economic development (tax breaks for corporations):</strong>
- $80M annually in Louisville tax abatements
- Often creates &lt;100 jobs ($800K per job)
- Many jobs low-wage</p>
<p><strong>Green infrastructure economic development:</strong>
- $42M annually in environmental/climate investment
- Creates 1,000+ jobs ($42K per job)
- Living-wage jobs, can't be outsourced</p>
<p><strong>Green infrastructure is BETTER economic development than corporate giveaways.</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion-environmental-justice-is-racial-justice">CONCLUSION: ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS RACIAL JUSTICE</h2>
<p>For over 70 years, Louisville has allowed Black communities to breathe toxic air, suffer preventable disease, and die premature deaths so chemical companies could profit and white neighborhoods could remain "clean." This environmental racism is not ancient history—it's ongoing, deliberate policy that our government maintains every day.</p>
<p>Dave Biggers believes <strong>clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment are fundamental rights</strong>—not privileges for the wealthy. Environmental justice and climate action are inseparable from racial justice, economic justice, and health equity.</p>
<p>This comprehensive environmental justice and climate action agenda will:
- Protect fence-line communities through real air monitoring, pollution reduction, and community decision-making power
- Plant 50,000 trees, reducing heat and improving air quality in West Louisville
- Build climate resilience through green infrastructure, heat response, and weatherization
- Transition to clean energy with solar, EVs, and 800+ good-paying clean energy jobs
- Create sustainable transportation with bike lanes, pedestrian safety, and EV charging</p>
<p><strong>Environmental racism ends now. Climate action begins today. Louisville's environmental future will benefit everyone—especially those who have suffered environmental harms for generations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dave will make Louisville a city where every resident can breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from pollution—regardless of zip code or skin color.</strong></p>
