<em>Same Total as Current Budget, Zero Tax Increase - Different Priorities</em></p><p><strong>LOUISVILLE, KY</strong> - Mayoral candidate Dave Biggers today released a comprehensive $1.2 billion budget plan for Louisville that maintains the same total spending as Mayor the current approved 2025-2026 budget while fundamentally reorienting city priorities toward prevention and community investment.</p><p>The plan, available in full at rundaverun.org, proposes no tax increases and no new borrowing. Instead, it reallocates approximately $150 million from administrative overhead and reactive services to proven prevention programs.</p><p><strong>KEY INNOVATIONS:</strong></p><p><strong>46 Mini Police Substations:</strong> Small neighborhood police offices across all Louisville zip codes where officers work on foot patrols, building community relationships. Cost: $30 million over 4 years (phased implementation: 12 in Year 1, all 46 by Year 4).</p><p><strong>18 Community Wellness Centers:</strong> One-stop healthcare hubs in underserved areas providing primary care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, and social services. Cost: $45 million when fully implemented (6 centers per year over 3 years).</p><p><strong>Enhanced Youth Programs:</strong> Consolidated and expanded after-school programs, 3,000 summer jobs, mentoring, and gang intervention. Cost: $55 million annually.</p><p><strong>Participatory Budgeting:</strong> $15 million for residents to directly vote on neighborhood spending priorities.</p><p>"Louisville deserves better than the status quo," said Biggers. "This budget proves you can have the same total spending, zero tax increase, and still transform public safety through evidence-based programs proven in 50+ American cities."</p><p>The approach is modeled on successful programs in Boston (63% reduction in youth homicides), Newark (35% reduction in shootings), and Los Angeles (18% violent crime reduction in program areas).</p><p><strong>POLICE BUDGET MAINTAINED:</strong> The Louisville Metro Police Department receives $245.9 million - exactly the same as the current approved budget. The difference is deployment: neighborhood-based community policing instead of centralized reactive policing.</p><p><strong>NO TAX INCREASE:</strong> Total budget of $1,265,754,100 matches the current approved 2025-2026 budget dollar-for-dollar.</p><p><strong>FULL TRANSPARENCY:</strong> The complete 831-line budget is public at rundaverun.org/budget.</p><p>Biggers' campaign focuses on evidence-based policy backed by research from dozens of cities that have successfully implemented similar approaches.</p><p><strong>Contact:</strong>

BUDGET OVERVIEW (500 WORDS)</h2><h3>A BUDGET FOR PREVENTION, NOT POLITICS</h3><p>Dave Biggers' $1.2 billion budget for Louisville represents the same total spending as Mayor the current approved 2025-2026 budget - but with fundamentally different priorities.</p><p><strong>THE APPROACH:</strong></p><p>Rather than continuing reactive, centralized services, the Biggers budget invests in prevention programs proven to reduce crime, improve health outcomes, and strengthen communities in 50+ American cities.</p><p><strong>SAME TOTAL, ZERO TAX INCREASE:</strong></p><p>At $1,265,754,100, the budget matches the current approved plan dollar-for-dollar. No new taxes. No new borrowing. Simply reallocation from low-impact spending (administrative overhead, jail costs) to high-impact prevention (community policing, wellness centers, youth programs).</p><p><strong>THE THREE TRANSFORMATIONS:</strong></p><p><strong>1. SAFER COMMUNITIES THROUGH PREVENTION ($395M Public Safety)</strong></p><p>The police budget remains at $245.9 million - identical to the current plan. The difference is deployment: 46 mini police substations across all Louisville zip codes where officers walk neighborhood beats, build relationships, and prevent crime before it happens.</p><p>This community policing model is used in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Baltimore. Average results: 20-30% crime reduction, 35% increase in community trust.</p><p>Additionally, 10 mental health crisis teams (social worker + officer) respond to calls involving mental illness or substance abuse, addressing root causes rather than just arresting symptoms.</p><p><strong>2. COMMUNITY INVESTMENT OVER BUREAUCRACY ($210M Community Programs)</strong></p><p>The budget consolidates scattered programs into 18 Community Wellness Centers strategically placed in underserved areas. Each center provides primary care, mental health counseling, addiction treatment, and social services navigation - all in one accessible location.</p><p>Evidence from similar programs nationwide: 35% reduction in emergency room visits, $5.60 saved for every $1 spent, dramatic improvements in chronic disease management and mental health outcomes.</p><p>Youth programs receive $55 million - consolidating existing scattered funding plus $20 million new investment. This includes after-school programs during peak crime hours (3-7pm), 3,000 summer jobs, mentoring, and gang intervention. Research shows 35% reduction in violent crime among participants.</p><p><strong>3. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE &amp; TRANSPARENCY ($15M Participatory Budgeting)</strong></p><p>Louisville residents will directly vote on $15 million in neighborhood spending through participatory budgeting - a process used successfully in 3,000+ cities worldwide including New York, Paris, Chicago, and Toronto.</p><p>Community meetings, project proposals, democratic voting, and city implementation create real citizen power over local priorities.</p><p><strong>WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM:</strong></p><ul><li>Administrative overhead reduction: -$14M</li>
<li>Jail population reduction through bail reform: -$36.5M</li>
<li>Service consolidation efficiencies: -$76M</li>
<li>Bureaucracy elimination: -$25M</li>
<li><strong>Total reallocated: ~$150M</strong></li></p><p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE:</strong></p><p>Year 1: 12 substations, 6 wellness centers, expanded youth programs
Year 4: All 46 substations, all 18 wellness centers, full program capacity
Goal: 35% crime reduction over 4 years</p><p><strong>TRANSPARENCY:</strong></p><p>The complete 831-line budget is public at rundaverun.org - the most detailed and transparent mayoral budget in Louisville history.</p><p><strong>THE EVIDENCE:</strong></p><p><li>Boston: 63% reduction in youth homicides (Operation Ceasefire)</li>
<li>Newark: 35% reduction in shootings (2013-2022)</li>
<li>Los Angeles: 18% violent crime reduction in GRYD program zones</li>
<li>Wellness centers: $5.60 ROI per dollar spent</li>

"This budget proves you don't need to raise taxes to transform public safety. You just need the courage to spend existing money on what actually works."</p><p><strong>On Evidence-Based Policy:</strong>
"I'm not asking Louisville to take a leap of faith. I'm showing our work. Fifty American cities have done this successfully. The evidence is overwhelming."</p><p><strong>On Police Funding:</strong>
"Police get the exact same budget - $245.9 million. The difference is we're deploying them smarter. Officers in neighborhoods preventing crime, not just in patrol cars responding to it."</p><p><strong>On Taxes:</strong>
"Zero tax increase. Zero new borrowing. This is the same $1.2 billion Louisville is already spending, just allocated to programs that actually work."</p><p><strong>On Transparency:</strong>
"This is the most transparent budget in Louisville history - 831 line items, all public. You can verify every number. That's accountability."</p><p><strong>On Crime Reduction:</strong>
"Boston reduced youth homicides 63%. Newark reduced shootings 35%. Los Angeles cut violent crime 18%. This isn't theory - it's proven results we can replicate."</p><p><strong>On Wellness Centers:</strong>
"You can't arrest your way out of mental illness and addiction. Prevention works better and costs less. Every dollar in wellness centers saves $5.60 in avoided costs."</p><p><strong>On Youth Programs:</strong>
"Kids in after-school programs and summer jobs are 35% less likely to commit crimes. That's not social work - that's smart policing."</p><p><strong>On Participatory Budgeting:</strong>
"Louisville residents know what their neighborhoods need better than any bureaucrat. Give them real power and they'll make smart decisions."</p><p><strong>On the Status Quo:</strong>
"The current approach hasn't worked. Crime isn't going down. It's time to try what's proven instead of hoping the same approach will magically get different results."</p><p><strong>On Leadership:</strong>
"Louisville needs a mayor who will implement proven solutions, even if it requires change. I have the courage to do what works, not what's comfortable."</p><p>---</p><h2>7.
