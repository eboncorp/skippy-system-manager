<h1>EMPLOYEE BILL OF RIGHTS</h1>
<h2>Comprehensive Compensation and Benefits for All Metro Employees</h2>
<p><strong>$27.4 Million Year 1 Investment in Louisville Metro's Workforce</strong>
<strong>$136.6 Million Four-Year Total Commitment</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Louisville Metro Government has a two-tier workforce: union employees with strong contracts securing 21-24% raises over recent years, and non-union employees receiving only 5% raises. This creates:</p>
<p>❌ Inequality and resentment among 3,500 non-union employees  
❌ Difficulty recruiting for non-union positions  
❌ High turnover in administrative, technical, and professional roles  
❌ Morale problems undermining service quality  
❌ Inability to compete with private sector and other cities  </p>
<p><strong>Current Reality:</strong> Public safety unions secured 21-24% raises. Everyone else got 5%.  
<strong>Our Solution:</strong> Employee Bill of Rights guaranteeing ALL employees comparable benefits.  
<strong>Impact:</strong> Equity, fairness, and competitive compensation for 6,000+ Metro employees.</p>

<hr />
<h2>ADDRESSING CONCERNS</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Can we afford this?</strong>  
A: Yes. 2.3-2.9% of annual budget. Funded through efficiency, not new taxes. Saves money long-term through reduced turnover ($9M annually).</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why should non-union get same as union?</strong>  
A: Because EVERYONE deserves fair pay. Current inequality hurts morale and service quality.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will this make union contracts more expensive?</strong>  
A: No. This matches current union benefits, doesn't exceed them. Sets parity, not new precedents.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What about the $1.2 billion budget?</strong>  
A: Corrected. Actual budget is $1.2 billion. Employee Bill of Rights based on accurate figures.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do we measure success?</strong>  
A: Track turnover, recruitment quality, employee satisfaction, service quality. Quarterly public reports from Employee Bill of Rights Oversight Committee.</p>
