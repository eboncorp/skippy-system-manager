<li>No new taxes</li>
<li>Reallocation, not new spending</li>

"This isn't a political experiment - it's proven in 50+ cities across America. Boston: 63% crime reduction. Newark: 35% reduction. Baltimore, Oakland, Philadelphia - all showing results. This is what works."</p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong>
<li>50+ cities using this approach</li>

<li>Realistic timelines (4-year rollout)</li>
<li>Partnership agreements in development</li>
<li>Professional transition planning</li>
<li>Governance-ready from inauguration</li></p><p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong>

<li>Policy forums</li>

"Public safety isn't just police - it's police AND mental health professionals AND community organizations AND you. We're building a system where everyone plays a role, from officers on the beat to wellness center staff to neighbors looking out for each other."</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<li>Co-responder teams (police + mental health professionals)</li>
<li>Community input on mini substation locations</li>

<li>Grassroots organizing</li></p><p>---</p><p><strong>THEME B: PREVENTION OVER REACTION</strong></p><p><strong>Message:</strong>
"For decades, we've waited until crisis happens, then responded with police. That's expensive and often too late. We're investing in preventing crisis - mental health care, addiction treatment, housing support, job training. Stop problems before they start."</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<li>Wellness centers providing mental health care before crisis</li>
<li>Co-responders reducing repeat 911 calls</li>
<li>Mini substations building relationships before problems escalate</li>

<li>Criminal justice reform discussions</li></p><p>---</p><p><strong>THEME C: LOUISVILLE LEADING THE NATION</strong></p><p><strong>Message:</strong>
"Other cities proved this works. Now it's our turn to lead. Louisville can become the national model - the city that got it right. Evidence-based, community-driven, fiscally responsible public safety that actually works."</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<li>Learning from Boston, Newark, Oakland</li>
<li>Improving on their models</li>
<li>University research partnerships documenting outcomes</li>
<li>National media attention when we succeed</li>
<li>Other cities will study Louisville</li></p><p><strong>Use When:</strong>
<li>Civic pride appeals</li>
<li>Business community (national attention = economic development)</li>
<li>University partnerships</li>
<li>Media seeking "big picture" angle</li>
<li>Vision casting moments</li></p><p>---</p><p><strong>THEME D: TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE</strong></p><p><strong>Message:</strong>
"Every dollar accounted for. Every decision explained. Monthly public reports on outcomes. Community input on major decisions. This is your city, your budget, your transformation - you deserve to see exactly how it works."</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<li>Budget published online (831 lines of detail)</li>
<li>Monthly public reports on mini substation progress</li>
<li>Community input on wellness center locations</li>
<li>Participatory budgeting process</li>
<li>Open data on crime, response times, outcomes</li></p><p><strong>Use When:</strong>
<li>Trust-building situations</li>
<li>Skeptical voters</li>
<li>Media accountability questions</li>
<li>Government transparency advocates</li>
<li>Contrasting with "politics as usual"</li></p><p>---</p><h2>AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC MESSAGING</h2><h3>For Progressive Voters:</h3><p><strong>Lead With:</strong>

<li>Condescension</li></p><p><strong>Sample Message:</strong>
"You've seen a lot of politicians make promises. I'm showing you the plan - detailed, budgeted, proven in 50+ cities. Mini substations mean safer neighborhoods. Same budget, no tax increase, better results. That's not a promise - it's a plan."</p><p>---</p><h2>OPPOSITION RESPONSE MESSAGING</h2><h3>Attack: "He's defunding the police"</h3><p><strong>NEVER Say:</strong>
❌ "I'm not defunding the police"
❌ "That's not true"
❌ "Stop lying"</p><p><strong>DO Say:</strong>
✅ "Same police budget. 46 mini police substations means MORE police presence in neighborhoods, not less. My plan puts officers where they're needed most - in your community, not stuck behind desks or responding to mental health calls that professionals should handle."</p><p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong>
"My opponent wants to keep the current system where police do everything - that doesn't work for police or community. I'm giving officers backup so they can focus on actual policing."</p><p>---</p><h3>Attack: "This costs too much"</h3><p><strong>NEVER Say:</strong>
❌ "It doesn't cost that much"
❌ "We'll find the money somehow"
❌ "Trust me on the math"</p><p><strong>DO Say:</strong>
✅ "$1.2 billion - the exact same total as the approved budget. Same. Not a penny more. The difference isn't how much we spend, it's how we spend it. My opponent is defending a system that's not working. I'm proposing smarter deployment of the same resources."</p><p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong>
"You know what's expensive? The current approach. Arresting people for mental health crisis instead of treating them. Reacting to crime instead of preventing it. My plan saves money long-term by investing in prevention."</p><p>---</p><h3>Attack: "This is a social experiment"</h3><p><strong>NEVER Say:</strong>
❌ "No it's not"
❌ "You're afraid of change"
❌ "Get with the times"</p><p><strong>DO Say:</strong>
✅ "Experiment? 50+ cities are already doing this. Boston: 63% crime reduction. Newark: 35% reduction. Cities with Republican mayors, Democratic mayors, big cities, small cities - all showing results. The experiment was thinking police alone could solve every social problem. We know better now."</p><p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong>
"I'm not asking you to trust me - I'm asking you to look at the evidence from dozens of American cities that prove this works."</p><p>---</p><h3>Attack: "He's soft on crime"</h3><p><strong>NEVER Say:</strong>
❌ "I'm tough on crime"
❌ "I'm not soft"
❌ Get defensive</p><p><strong>DO Say:</strong>
✅ "I'm smart on crime. Putting mental health professionals in a mental health crisis is smart. Putting police in neighborhoods before problems escalate is smart. Prevention is smart. The current approach isn't working - crime hasn't disappeared. I'm proposing what actually reduces crime, proven in 50+ cities."</p><p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong>
"Ask Boston, Newark, Oakland if this is soft on crime. Their crime rates dropped dramatically. That's results, not rhetoric."</p><p>---</p><h3>Attack: "Where's he getting the money?"</h3><p><strong>NEVER Say:</strong>
❌ "We'll find it"
❌ "Trust the process"
❌ "The math is complicated"</p><p><strong>DO Say:</strong>
✅ "Same total budget as already approved - $1.2 billion. I published an 831-line budget showing exactly where every dollar goes. It's online right now - rundaverun.org/budget. My opponent keeps asking where the money comes from while defending a budget that's the same size. This is reallocation, not new spending."</p><p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong>
"I have more budget transparency than any mayoral candidate in Louisville history. Every dollar accounted for. Every decision explained. That's governance, not politics."</p><p>---</p><h2>TONE &amp; STYLE GUIDE</h2><h3>DO Use These Tones:</h3><p>✅ <strong>Confident, Not Arrogant</strong>
"We know this works because we've seen the data from 50+ cities."</p><p>✅ <strong>Respectful, Not Dismissive</strong>
"I understand the concern about change. Let me show you why this approach works."</p><p>✅ <strong>Specific, Not Vague</strong>
"46 mini substations, 18 wellness centers, 4-year rollout. Here's the plan."</p><p>✅ <strong>Optimistic, Not Pollyanna</strong>
"This won't solve every problem overnight. But we can make Louisville safer, and we have a proven path to do it."</p><p>✅ <strong>Inclusive, Not Divisive</strong>
"This is about all of Louisville - East End, West End, every neighborhood deserves safety."</p><p>---</p><h3>DON'T Use These Tones:</h3><p>❌ <strong>Defensive</strong>
"You're wrong about me..."</p><p>❌ <strong>Attacking Voters</strong>
"If you don't understand this..."</p><p>❌ <strong>Jargon-Heavy</strong>
"The multimodal crisis intervention paradigm..."</p><p>❌ <strong>Overpromising</strong>
"I'll eliminate crime in Louisville..."</p><p>❌ <strong>Partisan</strong>
"The Republicans/Democrats always..."</p><p>---</p><h2>WORD CHOICE GUIDE</h2><h3>Use These Words:</h3><p>✅ Community

❌ Revolutionary</p><p>---</p><h2>STORYTELLING FRAMEWORK</h2><h3>The Hero's Journey Structure:</h3><p><strong>Current State (Problem):</strong>
"Louisville has a public safety system built for the 1970s. We're asking police to do everything - mental health calls, addiction crises, homelessness, traffic enforcement, actual crime. They can't do it all well, and they know it."</p><p><strong>Crisis Point:</strong>
"Response times are too slow. Crime is still too high. Officers are overwhelmed. Families in crisis aren't getting the help they need. The current approach isn't working for anyone - not police, not community."</p><p><strong>The Path Forward (Solution):</strong>
"Other cities faced the same problem. They tried a different approach - specialized response for different situations. Police for police matters. Mental health professionals for mental health crises. Prevention before reaction. And it worked."</p><p><strong>The Results (Vision):</strong>
"Boston: 63% reduction. Newark: 35% reduction. Better outcomes for everyone - police focus on actual policing, people in crisis get actual help, communities feel safer. That's what we're building in Louisville."</p><p><strong>The Call to Action:</strong>
"We know what works. We have the plan. We have the budget. Now we need the political will to make it happen. That starts with electing leadership ready to govern based on evidence, not politics."</p><p>---</p><h2>PERSONAL NARRATIVES (Dave's Story)</h2><h3>Why Dave Is Running:</h3><p>"I've spent years studying what works in public safety - not what feels good politically, not what makes for good soundbites, but what actually reduces crime and helps communities. I've seen the data from 50+ cities. I've talked to police chiefs, mental health professionals, community leaders who've implemented these approaches. It works. Louisville deserves leadership that follows evidence, not politics. That's why I'm running."</p><h3>What Makes Dave Different:</h3><p>"Most candidates show up with a list of problems and some vague promises. I'm showing up with an 831-line budget, detailed implementation plans, and evidence from dozens of cities proving this works. I'm not promising you the moon - I'm showing you the roadmap. That's the difference between campaigning and governing."</p><h3>Dave's Vision for Louisville:</h3><p>"I see a Louisville where your neighborhood has a police substation two minutes away, not twenty. Where someone in a mental health crisis gets a mental health professional, not just an officer with handcuffs. Where we prevent problems instead of just reacting to them. Where we lead the nation in evidence-based governance. That Louisville is possible - and I have the plan to build it."</p><p>---</p><h2>DEBATE PREPARATION MESSAGING</h2><h3>Opening Statement Framework:</h3><p>"Good evening. I'm Dave Biggers, and I'm running for mayor because Louisville deserves evidence-based governance, not politics as usual.</p><p>I have a detailed plan to transform public safety: 46 mini police substations in neighborhoods, 18 wellness centers for mental health and addiction, co-responder teams putting the right professional in the right situation.</p><p>This isn't a political experiment - it's proven in 50+ cities across America.

That's governance.</p><p>Louisville can lead the nation in evidence-based public safety. But we need leadership ready to govern from day one. I'm that leader, and I'm ready. Thank you."</p><h3>Closing Statement Framework:</h3><p>"Tonight you've heard a lot of talk. Let me leave you with action.</p><p>I published an 831-line budget - online right now.

I have blueprints.</p><p>I can name the 50+ cities using this approach and show you their results. My opponents have hope.
