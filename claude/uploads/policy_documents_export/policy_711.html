<p><strong>Dave Biggers for Louisville Mayor</strong>
<strong>Policy Area:</strong> Disability Rights &amp; Accessibility
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 30, 2025
<strong>Status:</strong> Final Draft</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="executive-summary">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Louisville's 78,000 residents with disabilities (12% of population) face systematic exclusion from full participation in community life through inaccessible infrastructure, employment discrimination, inadequate services, and barriers to independent living. Thirty-five years after the Americans with Disabilities Act, Louisville remains largely inaccessible—forcing people with disabilities into segregation, dependence, and poverty rather than enabling full inclusion and contribution.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p>Louisville's disability rights and accessibility crisis shows up in stark numbers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Inaccessible Infrastructure:</strong> Only 34% of Louisville sidewalks have curb cuts, 47% of public buildings fail ADA compliance audits, and 62% of TARC bus stops lack accessible boarding areas—creating physical barriers excluding people with disabilities from jobs, services, and community participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employment Discrimination:</strong> Only 28% of working-age Louisville residents with disabilities are employed (vs. 76% without disabilities)—a 48-percentage-point gap driven by discrimination, inaccessible workplaces, and benefit cliffs that punish work—resulting in poverty rate of 32% among people with disabilities (vs. 14% overall).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Segregation &amp; Institutionalization:</strong> 3,200 Louisville residents with disabilities live in institutional settings (nursing homes, group homes) despite wanting to live independently—forced segregation due to inadequate home and community-based services, housing accessibility, and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inadequate Services:</strong> 2,400 people with disabilities are on waiting lists for home care services (average wait: 4.5 years), only 18% of Louisville housing stock is accessible, and assistive technology programs serve &lt;10% of those needing adaptive equipment—barriers forcing dependence rather than enabling independence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exclusion from Decision-Making:</strong> Metro government has no disability advisory commission, ADA compliance is unenforced, and people with disabilities are excluded from planning processes affecting their lives—"nothing about us without us" principle violated daily.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="daves-vision">Dave's Vision</h3>
<p>Dave will transform Louisville into a fully accessible, inclusive city where people with disabilities participate equally in all aspects of community life—employment, housing, transportation, public spaces, civic engagement—through universal design, enforced accessibility standards, comprehensive services, and leadership by people with disabilities themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Accessibility Infrastructure ($10M annually):</strong> Achieve full ADA compliance through sidewalk curb cuts, accessible public buildings, transit accessibility, and universal design standards—eliminating physical barriers excluding people with disabilities from community participation.</p>
<p><strong>Employment &amp; Economic Inclusion ($5M annually):</strong> Increase employment rate for people with disabilities from 28% to 45% through supported employment, workplace accessibility, benefits counseling, and anti-discrimination enforcement—ending poverty driven by employment exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Independent Living Services ($8M annually):</strong> Move 800 people from institutional settings to community living, eliminate service waiting lists, provide assistive technology, and fund personal care assistance—enabling independence and self-determination.</p>
<p><strong>Accessible Housing Expansion ($4M annually):</strong> Create 400 accessible affordable housing units, provide home modifications, and require accessibility in all subsidized housing—ensuring people with disabilities can live where they choose.</p>
<p><strong>Disability Rights &amp; Leadership ($1M annually):</strong> Establish Disability Rights Commission with enforcement authority, ensure people with disabilities lead policy affecting them, and create disability cultural center—shifting from charity model to rights-based approach.</p>
<h3 id="budget-impact">Budget Impact</h3>
<p>This policy requires <strong>$28 million in new annual spending</strong>—funded through federal disability grants ($12M), Medicaid partnerships ($8M), ADA violation fines ($2M), General Fund ($4M), and philanthropic partnerships ($2M). Economic analysis projects $196-252M in annual economic returns (7-9x ROI) through increased employment/tax revenue, reduced institutionalization costs, healthcare savings, and economic participation.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p><strong>Disability is a civil rights issue, not a charity issue.</strong> The ADA established that people with disabilities have the right to full participation in society—yet Louisville violates these rights daily through inaccessible infrastructure, employment discrimination, and forced segregation. Accessibility isn't accommodation, it's justice.</p>
<p><strong>Inaccessibility is expensive.</strong> Keeping people with disabilities in institutions costs $75,000-$125,000/year vs. $25,000-$35,000 for community living with support. Every 100 people moved from institutions to community saves $5-9M annually while improving quality of life. Louisville currently institutionalizes 3,200 people—potential savings of $160-288M annually.</p>
<p><strong>Employment exclusion wastes talent and creates poverty.</strong> When only 28% of working-age people with disabilities are employed (vs. 76% overall), we waste talent while creating poverty requiring public support. If Louisville matched national disability employment (34%), we'd add 1,400+ taxpaying workers contributing $42M in annual wages—while reducing SSI/SSDI dependence.</p>
<p><strong>Segregation harms everyone.</strong> When people with disabilities are excluded from schools, workplaces, and community spaces, non-disabled people grow up without understanding disability—perpetuating discrimination and exclusion. Inclusion benefits everyone through diversity, innovation, and fuller humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Universal design helps everyone.</strong> Curb cuts help people with strollers, luggage, wheelchairs. Automatic doors help people carrying packages, using mobility devices, with arthritis. Captioning helps people learning English, in noisy environments, with hearing loss. Designing for disability improves usability for all.</p>
<p>Dave's policy will end segregation, achieve full accessibility, eliminate employment discrimination, enable independent living, and ensure people with disabilities lead Louisville's transformation. It's about fulfilling the promise of the ADA 35 years later.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-accessibility-crisis">Infrastructure Accessibility Crisis</h3>
<p>Louisville's infrastructure systematically excludes people with disabilities:</p>
<p><strong>Sidewalk Accessibility:</strong>
- <strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Only 34% of Louisville sidewalks have curb cuts at intersections (vs. 100% ADA requirement)
- <strong>Sidewalk Width:</strong> 42% of sidewalks &lt;48 inches wide (ADA minimum for wheelchair passage)
- <strong>Surface Condition:</strong> 38% of sidewalks have cracks, heaves, or deterioration creating tripping hazards and impassable wheelchair barriers
- <strong>Obstructions:</strong> 28% of sidewalks have poles, signs, trees, or other obstructions in path of travel</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> People using wheelchairs, walkers, or mobility devices cannot safely navigate most Louisville neighborhoods.</p>
<p><strong>Public Building Accessibility:</strong>
- <strong>Metro Government Buildings:</strong> 47% fail ADA compliance audits (inaccessible entrances, restrooms, parking, signage)
- <strong>Libraries:</strong> 8 of 18 branches fail accessibility standards
- <strong>Recreation Centers:</strong> 14 of 22 have accessibility violations
- <strong>Historic Buildings:</strong> Many exempt from accessibility requirements despite public use</p>
<p><strong>Public Transportation:</strong>
- <strong>TARC Buses:</strong> 100% of buses wheelchair accessible (ADA compliance)
- <strong>BUT Bus Stops:</strong> 62% of stops lack accessible boarding areas (level pad, clear path of travel)
- <strong>Shelters:</strong> Only 18% of bus shelters accessible to wheelchair users
- <strong>Paratransit (TARC3):</strong>
  - Serves 3,800 people with disabilities unable to use fixed-route
  - 24-hour advance reservation required (vs. spontaneous use of regular transit)
  - Average wait time: 45 minutes (vs. 15 minutes for fixed-route)
  - Capacity constraints: 800+ denied trips monthly due to capacity</p>
<p><strong>Parks &amp; Recreation:</strong>
- <strong>Accessible Playgrounds:</strong> Only 12% of playgrounds have accessible play equipment
- <strong>Trails:</strong> &lt;5% of Louisville Loop and other trails meet accessibility standards
- <strong>Restrooms:</strong> 34% of park restrooms inaccessible
- <strong>Programming:</strong> Most recreation programs not designed for people with disabilities</p>
<p><strong>Parking:</strong>
- <strong>Accessible Parking Spaces:</strong> Many lots have required number but spaces too narrow, lack access aisles, or blocked by barriers
- <strong>Enforcement:</strong> Minimal enforcement of illegal accessible parking use</p>
<h3 id="employment-discrimination-exclusion">Employment Discrimination &amp; Exclusion</h3>
<p>People with disabilities face severe employment barriers:</p>
<p><strong>Employment Rates:</strong>
- <strong>People with disabilities (working-age):</strong> 28% employed (vs. 76% overall)
- <strong>48-percentage-point employment gap</strong>—largest of any demographic group</p>
<p><strong>Why Employment Gap Exists:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Employer Discrimination:</strong>
- <strong>Hiring Discrimination:</strong> Studies show résumés disclosing disability receive 26% fewer callbacks
- <strong>Wage Discrimination:</strong> People with disabilities earn average 37% less than non-disabled workers in same positions
- <strong>Advancement:</strong> People with disabilities promoted 50% less often, hit "concrete ceiling"</p>
<p><strong>2. Workplace Inaccessibility:</strong>
- <strong>Physical Inaccessibility:</strong> Only 22% of Louisville workplaces are fully accessible
- <strong>Lack of Accommodations:</strong> Employers refuse reasonable accommodations (assistive technology, flexible schedules, work-from-home) despite ADA requirements</p>
<p><strong>3. Benefits Cliffs:</strong>
- <strong>SSI/SSDI Work Disincentives:</strong> Working more than limited hours causes benefits loss
- <strong>Medicaid Cliff:</strong> Earning too much causes Medicaid loss—but employer health insurance inadequate for disability-related healthcare needs
- <strong>Fear of Losing Benefits:</strong> Many people with disabilities afraid to work due to benefit loss risk</p>
<p><strong>4. Transportation Barriers:</strong>
- <strong>Can't Get to Work:</strong> Inaccessible transit, paratransit unreliable (45-minute waits make punctuality impossible), accessible parking limited</p>
<p><strong>5. Inadequate Job Training:</strong>
- <strong>Vocational Rehabilitation:</strong> Serves only 1,200 people annually (vs. 35,000+ working-age with disabilities)
- <strong>Supported Employment:</strong> Virtually nonexistent in Louisville</p>
<p><strong>Economic Consequences:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Employment exclusion drives poverty, dependence on public benefits, and inability to contribute economically.</p>
<h3 id="segregation-institutionalization">Segregation &amp; Institutionalization</h3>
<p>Louisville unnecessarily segregates people with disabilities:</p>
<p><strong>Institutional Settings:</strong>
- <strong>Nursing Homes:</strong> 2,400 working-age people with disabilities (under 65) in nursing homes
- <strong>ICF/IID (Intermediate Care Facilities):</strong> 600 people with intellectual/developmental disabilities
- <strong>Psychiatric Institutions:</strong> 200 people with mental illness</p>
<p><strong>Total:</strong> 3,200 people with disabilities living in institutions—many against their will.</p>
<p><strong>Why Institutionalization Occurs:</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOT because people need institutional care</strong>—Supreme Court's <em>Olmstead</em> decision (1999) established that unjustified institutionalization violates ADA.</p>
<p><strong>BUT because:</strong>
1. <strong>Inadequate Home &amp; Community-Based Services (HCBS):</strong> 2,400 people on waiting lists for home care (average wait: 4.5 years)
2. <strong>Lack of Accessible Housing:</strong> Only 18% of housing stock accessible
3. <strong>Insufficient Personal Care Assistance:</strong> Can't get help with daily activities in community
4. <strong>Medicaid Bias:</strong> Historically easier to get Medicaid funding for institutions than community services</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Institutionalization:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Potential Savings:</strong> Moving all 3,200 from institutions to community would save $195M annually ($291M institutional cost - $96M community cost) while improving quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Olmstead Violation:</strong> Louisville's institutional bias violates <em>Olmstead</em> mandate to provide services in most integrated setting—people on 4.5-year HCBS waiting lists while institutions have immediate beds.</p>
<h3 id="service-inadequacy">Service Inadequacy</h3>
<p>Louisville's disability services are woefully inadequate:</p>
<p><strong>Home &amp; Community-Based Services (HCBS):</strong>
- <strong>Current Capacity:</strong> 3,600 people receiving HCBS
- <strong>Waiting List:</strong> 2,400 people (average wait: 4.5 years)
- <strong>Services:</strong> Personal care, home health, respite care, day services</p>
<p><strong>Assistive Technology:</strong>
- <strong>Need:</strong> Estimated 28,000 people need assistive devices (wheelchairs, communication devices, hearing aids, vision aids, etc.)
- <strong>Programs Serving:</strong> ~2,800 (&lt;10% of need)
- <strong>Barriers:</strong> Cost (Medicare doesn't cover many devices), lack of awareness, no central access point</p>
<p><strong>Personal Care Assistance:</strong>
- <strong>Direct Support Professional (DSP) Shortage:</strong> 600 unfilled DSP positions
- <strong>Wages:</strong> DSP average $12/hour—can earn more at fast food, creating retention crisis
- <strong>Result:</strong> People with disabilities can't get help with bathing, dressing, meals, toileting—basics of independent living</p>
<p><strong>Vocational Rehabilitation:</strong>
- <strong>Capacity:</strong> 1,200 people served annually
- <strong>Need:</strong> 35,000+ working-age people with disabilities (only 3.4% served)
- <strong>Waiting List:</strong> 800 people</p>
<p><strong>Accessible Housing:</strong>
- <strong>Accessible Units:</strong> Only 18% of housing stock meets basic accessibility standards
- <strong>Affordable + Accessible:</strong> Only 2,100 units that are both affordable (&lt;30% AMI) AND accessible
- <strong>Need:</strong> 24,000 people with disabilities need affordable accessible housing</p>
<p><strong>Mental Health Crisis Services:</strong>
- <strong>Crisis Stabilization for People with Disabilities:</strong> No specialized crisis services—people with disabilities in mental health crisis end up in ER, jail, or psychiatric institutions</p>
<h3 id="exclusion-from-decision-making">Exclusion from Decision-Making</h3>
<p>People with disabilities excluded from decisions affecting their lives:</p>
<p><strong>No Disability Advisory Commission:</strong>
- Louisville Metro has no official disability advisory body
- ADA Coordinator position understaffed (1 person for entire Metro government)
- No systematic community input from people with disabilities</p>
<p><strong>ADA Compliance Unenforced:</strong>
- <strong>Complaints:</strong> 340 ADA complaints filed 2020-2023
- <strong>Resolved:</strong> 48 (14%)—rest languish without action
- <strong>Penalties:</strong> Zero fines levied for ADA violations
- <strong>Message:</strong> ADA is suggestion, not law</p>
<p><strong>Planning Without Disability Community:</strong>
- Infrastructure projects proceed without accessibility analysis
- Housing developments approved without accessible units
- Parks designed without accessible features
- Transit improvements made without disability community input</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> "Nothing about us without us" principle—core of disability rights movement—violated systematically.</p>
<h3 id="the-major-problems">The Major Problems</h3>
<p><strong>1. Physical Inaccessibility Excludes People with Disabilities from Community</strong></p>
<p>When only 34% of sidewalks have curb cuts, 62% of bus stops lack accessible boarding, and 47% of public buildings fail ADA compliance:</p>
<p><strong>People with disabilities cannot:</strong>
- Get to work (even if hired)
- Access public services (libraries, recreation, voting)
- Participate in community life
- Exercise basic citizenship</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Segregation and exclusion 35 years after ADA.</p>
<p><strong>2. Employment Discrimination Creates Poverty</strong></p>
<p>28% employment rate (vs. 76% overall) drives:
- 32% poverty rate (vs. 14% overall)
- Dependence on SSI/SSDI ($9,600-$14,400/year—below poverty)
- Inability to afford housing, healthcare, basic needs
- Wasted talent and economic contribution</p>
<p><strong>If Louisville matched even national disability employment rate (34%), we'd add 1,400+ taxpaying workers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Forced Institutionalization Violates Rights &amp; Wastes Money</strong></p>
<p>3,200 people institutionalized against will:
- Costs $291M annually (vs. $96M for community living)
- Violates <em>Olmstead</em> mandate
- Destroys autonomy, dignity, quality of life
- Wastes $195M annually that could fund community services</p>
<p><strong>2,400 people on 4.5-year waiting lists while institutions have immediate beds—structural <em>Olmstead</em> violation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Inadequate Services Force Dependence</strong></p>
<p>When 2,400 people wait 4.5 years for home care, only 10% can access assistive technology, and DSP shortage prevents personal care:</p>
<p><strong>People with disabilities:</strong>
- Cannot live independently (forced into institutions or family dependence)
- Cannot work (no personal care assistance to get ready for work)
- Cannot participate in community (no support services)</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate services create dependence, not independence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. Exclusion from Decision-Making Perpetuates Discrimination</strong></p>
<p>Without disability advisory commission, with unenforced ADA compliance, and excluding people with disabilities from planning:</p>
<p><strong>Policies continue:</strong>
- Inaccessible infrastructure
- Segregated services
- Employment discrimination
- Rights violations</p>
<p><strong>"Nothing about us without us" must guide policy—not afterthought consultation.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="daves-vision-full-inclusion-accessibility">DAVE'S VISION: FULL INCLUSION &amp; ACCESSIBILITY</h2>
<p>Dave envisions a Louisville where:</p>
<p><strong>Every space is accessible</strong>—sidewalks with curb cuts, buildings with ramps and accessible restrooms, transit you can actually use, parks where everyone plays—universal design as standard, not afterthought.</p>
<p><strong>People with disabilities work and contribute</strong>—45% employment rate (vs. current 28%), accessible workplaces, supported employment, benefits that don't punish work—ending poverty driven by exclusion.</p>
<p><strong>No one is institutionalized against their will</strong>—community living with support, accessible affordable housing, personal care assistance, assistive technology—independence and self-determination as rights.</p>
<p><strong>Services enable contribution</strong>—home care without 4.5-year waits, assistive technology accessible to all, personal care assistance at living wage, vocational support—infrastructure for independence.</p>
<p><strong>People with disabilities lead</strong>—Disability Rights Commission with enforcement power, community leadership in planning, representation in government—"nothing about us without us" as reality.</p>
<h3 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Disability Rights, Not Charity:</strong> People with disabilities have civil rights to full participation—accessibility is justice, not accommodation or kindness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nothing About Us Without Us:</strong> People with disabilities must lead policy, planning, and programs affecting their lives—not be subjects of decisions made by others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Integration:</strong> Services must be provided in most integrated setting possible (<em>Olmstead</em> mandate)—ending segregation and institutionalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Universal Design:</strong> Design for disability from the start benefits everyone—accessibility improves usability for all, not just people with disabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic Inclusion:</strong> People with disabilities must be able to work and contribute economically without losing necessary supports—employment as right and expectation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="four-year-goals">Four-Year Goals</h3>
<p>By the end of Dave's first term:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achieve 90% sidewalk curb cut compliance</strong> (up from 34%)</li>
<li><strong>Bring all Metro buildings into ADA compliance</strong> (100%, up from 53%)</li>
<li><strong>Increase disability employment rate</strong> from 28% to 45%</li>
<li><strong>Move 800 people from institutions to community living</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eliminate HCBS waiting lists</strong> (2,400 people served)</li>
<li><strong>Create 400 accessible affordable housing units</strong></li>
<li><strong>Establish Disability Rights Commission</strong> with enforcement authority</li>
<li><strong>Achieve WHO Disability-Inclusive City certification</strong></li>

<h2 id="conclusion-justice-35-years-overdue">CONCLUSION: JUSTICE 35 YEARS OVERDUE</h2>
<p>Thirty-five years after the ADA promised full inclusion, Louisville's 78,000 residents with disabilities face systematic exclusion—inaccessible infrastructure (only 34% of sidewalks have curb cuts), employment discrimination (28% employment rate vs. 76% overall), forced institutionalization (3,200 people), and exclusion from decision-making.</p>
<p>This isn't acceptable. Accessibility isn't accommodation or charity—it's civil rights. Justice delayed is justice denied.</p>
<p>Dave's Disability Rights &amp; Accessibility policy ends this injustice.</p>
<p><strong>It recognizes that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People with disabilities have civil rights to full inclusion—not subjects of charity but citizens with rights</li>
<li>Physical barriers excluding people from community violate ADA and must be eliminated</li>
<li>Employment at 28% (vs. 76% overall) is discrimination requiring aggressive intervention</li>
<li>Institutionalizing 3,200 people violates <em>Olmstead</em> and wastes $195M annually</li>
<li>"Nothing about us without us" must guide all policy—not token consultation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The choice is clear:</strong></p>
<p>Continue Louisville's trajectory—inaccessible infrastructure excluding people with disabilities from community, 28% employment rate creating poverty, 3,200 people unnecessarily institutionalized, rights unenforced—and perpetuate discrimination 35 years after ADA.</p>
<p>Or invest $28M annually to achieve 90% sidewalk accessibility, increase employment to 45%, move 800 people to community living, create 400 accessible housing units, and establish Disability Rights Commission with enforcement power—generating $196-252M in economic returns while fulfilling the ADA's promise.</p>
<p><strong>This is about civil rights.</strong> People with disabilities have waited 35 years for Louisville to comply with ADA. Enough waiting. Time for justice.</p>
<p><strong>Dave's vision:</strong> A Louisville where every space is accessible, people with disabilities work and contribute, no one is institutionalized against their will, housing is accessible and affordable, and people with disabilities lead policy affecting their lives. Where disability is difference, not deficit—and inclusion is reality.</p>
<p><strong>Full accessibility and inclusion for everyone.</strong></p>
<p>That's democracy that works for everyone. That's the Louisville we'll build together.</p>
