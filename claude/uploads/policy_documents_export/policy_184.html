<h1>DAVE BIGGERS FOR MAYOR</h1>
<h2>A Day in the Life: How the Budget Changes Your Louisville</h2>
<h3>Same Money. Different Day. Better Life.</h3><p><strong>Budget Version:</strong> 3.1 ($1.2 billion)  
<strong>Updated:</strong> October 12, 2025</p><p>---</p><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><p>Numbers in a budget don't tell the whole story. So let's tell the human story.</p><p>Here's what a day in Louisville looks like under Mayor the current current budget versus what it would look like under Dave Biggers' budget - <strong>same $1.2 billion total, completely different experience for real people.</strong></p><p>These aren't hypotheticals. Every scenario below is based on actual Louisville residents and real challenges they face. Only the names have been changed.</p><p><strong>Same money. Different priorities. Better Louisville.</strong></p><p>---</p><h2>MORNING: GETTING KIDS TO SCHOOL</h2><h3><strong>JENNIFER, Single Mother in Russell (West Louisville)</strong></h3><h4>UNDER THE CURRENT BUDGET (Current Louisville):</h4><p><strong>6:45 AM</strong> - Jennifer's alarm goes off. She's exhausted - worked late at her second job at the UPS warehouse. Her son Tyler, 8, had trouble sleeping. He heard gunshots last night on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard.</p><p><strong>7:15 AM</strong> - Jennifer walks Tyler to school down West Madison Street. The route passes three abandoned houses. Last month, someone was robbed near one of them. She holds his hand tightly and walks fast.</p><p><strong>7:30 AM</strong> - At the school crossing on 26th Street, cars blow through the zone at 45 mph. There's supposed to be a crossing guard, but the position hasn't been filled in months. Jennifer waits for a gap in traffic and practically drags Tyler across.</p><p><strong>7:35 AM</strong> - Tyler is safely at Wheatley Elementary, but Jennifer is anxious. There was another fight at the school this week. The resource officer can't be everywhere. She worries all day about 3pm when Tyler will walk home alone while she's at her shift.</p><p><strong>Jennifer's day:</strong> Anxiety about Tyler's safety. No after-school options she can afford. Constant worry.</p><p>---</p><h4>UNDER BIGGERS' BUDGET (Prevention-First Louisville):</h4><p><strong>6:45 AM</strong> - Jennifer's alarm goes off. She slept better - the mini police substation opened on 28th Street three months ago. Officer Rodriguez walks the beat every evening. Crime in Russell has dropped 22% already.</p><p><strong>7:15 AM</strong> - Jennifer walks Tyler to school past the mini substation. Officer Rodriguez is outside, waving to neighbors. "Morning, Jennifer! Morning, Tyler!" Tyler waves back excitedly. He knows Officer Rodriguez from the community barbecue the substation hosted last month.</p><p><strong>7:30 AM</strong> - At the school crossing on 26th Street, traffic actually slows down. The automated speed cameras went in six weeks ago, and word spread fast. The crossing guard, Mrs. Patterson, waves them across safely. "Have a great day, Tyler!"</p><p><strong>7:35 AM</strong> - Tyler is at Wheatley Elementary. Jennifer doesn't worry - he'll stay for the after-school program (basketball, art, and homework help until 6pm when Jennifer gets off work). He's safer there than home alone, and he's thriving. His grades are up.</p><p><strong>Jennifer's day:</strong> Peace of mind. Tyler is safe, supervised, and learning. She can focus on work.</p><p><strong>THE BUDGET DIFFERENCE:</strong>
<ul><li>Mini substation in Russell: $650K annually (part of 46 substations = $30M over 4 years)</li>
<li>School zone safety program: $5M citywide (30 schools with automated cameras)</li>
<li>After-school programs expanded: Part of $55M youth development investment</li>
<li><strong>Net cost: $0 - Same total budget as the current, just reallocated from administrative overhead</strong></li></p><p>---</p><h2>MIDDAY: DEALING WITH A CRISIS</h2><h3><strong>MARCUS, Unemployed Veteran in Okolona, Struggling with PTSD</strong></h3><h4>UNDER THE CURRENT BUDGET (Current Louisville):</h4><p><strong>11:30 AM</strong> - Marcus is having a bad day in his apartment off Preston Highway. PTSD is hitting hard - panic attacks, flashbacks from Afghanistan. He needs help but doesn't know where to turn. His VA benefits don't cover enough therapy sessions.</p><p><strong>12:00 PM</strong> - He calls 911, desperate. Dispatch sends two LMPD officers. They mean well, but they're not trained mental health professionals. They see Marcus is armed (legal gun owner, concealed carry permit). The situation gets tense.</p><p><strong>12:30 PM</strong> - Marcus is in handcuffs, being taken to University Hospital ER for psychiatric evaluation. He's treated like a criminal instead of a veteran in crisis. The ER wait is 6 hours. He'll get a massive bill he can't afford. The cycle continues.</p><p><strong>6:00 PM</strong> - Marcus is released from the ER with a prescription for meds he can't afford and a card for a therapist who doesn't take his insurance and has a 3-month waitlist. He's humiliated, angry, and still in crisis. Next time, he won't call 911.</p><p><strong>Marcus's day:</strong> Crisis became trauma. System failed him. He's worse off than when he started.</p><p>---</p><h4>UNDER BIGGERS' BUDGET (Prevention-First Louisville):</h4><p><strong>11:30 AM</strong> - Marcus is having a bad day in his apartment. PTSD is hitting hard. But he has the number for the Community Wellness Center that opened on Preston Highway last year - his neighbor who's also a vet told him about it.</p><p><strong>12:00 PM</strong> - He walks to the wellness center (7 minutes from his apartment complex). The receptionist recognizes signs of crisis and immediately gets him with Angela, a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in veteran mental health and PTSD.</p><p><strong>12:30 PM</strong> - Angela does a crisis intervention session with Marcus. She's trained in trauma-informed care. She helps him through the panic attack, provides coping strategies, and schedules him for ongoing therapy sessions starting tomorrow - all covered by the wellness center.</p><p><strong>1:30 PM</strong> - Marcus leaves the center feeling heard and helped. Angela also connected him with the center's job placement program - they're working with local employers to hire veterans. He has an interview lined up with a warehouse on Outer Loop next week.</p><p><strong>Three months later</strong> - Marcus is working full-time. He's in weekly therapy. His PTSD is more manageable. He hasn't had a crisis severe enough to need emergency services in 90 days. He's mentoring another vet through the program.</p><p><strong>Marcus's day:</strong> Crisis became care. System supported him. He's on a path to recovery.</p><p><strong>THE BUDGET DIFFERENCE:</strong>
<li>Community Wellness Center in Okolona: Part of $45M wellness investment (18 centers at $2.5M each)</li>
<li>Mental health crisis team: Part of $7M mobile crisis program</li>
<li>Cost to James: $0</li>
<li>Cost to taxpayers: Every $1 in wellness center saves $5.60 in healthcare costs within 5 years</li>
<li><strong>Net result: Prevention is cheaper AND more effective than crisis response</strong></li></p><p>---</p><h2>AFTERNOON: YOUTH AT RISK</h2><h3><strong>ALEX, 16-Year-Old Student at Doss High School (Newburg)</strong></h3><h4>UNDER THE CURRENT BUDGET (Current Louisville):</h4><p><strong>3:00 PM</strong> - School lets out at Doss High. Alex's home on Fern Valley Road is empty - his mom works until 7pm at the Amazon warehouse. His dad isn't in the picture.</p><p><strong>3:30 PM</strong> - Alex hangs out with friends on the corner of Fern Valley and Bardstown. There's nothing to do. No programs. No jobs. Just time to kill.</p><p><strong>4:30 PM</strong> - Some older guys from the neighborhood pull up. They offer Alex $50 to deliver a package across town. He knows what's in it. He's done it before. The money helps his mom with rent.</p><p><strong>5:30 PM</strong> - Alex delivers the package. He's anxious the whole time - what if police stop him? But his mom needs the money, and legitimate jobs for 16-year-olds don't exist in his neighborhood.</p><p><strong>6:00 PM</strong> - Alex's back on the corner with $50 cash. His friends respect him. The older guys say they might have more work for him. Alex knows this path leads nowhere good, but what choice does he have?</p><p><strong>Alex's trajectory:</strong> Deeper into illegal economy. High risk of arrest, injury, or worse. Limited legitimate opportunities.</p><p>---</p><h4>UNDER BIGGERS' BUDGET (Prevention-First Louisville):</h4><p><strong>3:00 PM</strong> - School lets out at Doss High. Alex heads to the after-school program in the cafeteria - basketball practice, then homework help with the math tutor.</p><p><strong>3:30 PM</strong> - Alex's on the court playing pickup with 20 other students. Coach Thompson, who's also a mentor in the youth program, is working with him on his jump shot. More importantly, they talk about Alex's future.</p><p><strong>4:30 PM</strong> - After basketball, Alex hits the homework room. A volunteer tutor helps him with algebra. His grades have gone from C's to B's since he started the program three months ago.</p><p><strong>5:30 PM</strong> - The job counselor stops by. She's working with Alex on his resume - he's applying for a summer youth job through the city's program. 3,000 positions for Louisville teens. $15/hour for 30 hours/week. Alex's interview is next week.</p><p><strong>6:00 PM</strong> - Alex's mom picks him up. He's excited about the job interview and tells her about basketball practice. She's not worried about what he's doing between 3-7pm anymore - she knows he's safe, supervised, and building a future.</p><p><strong>Summer, three months later</strong> - Alex gets the job working with Louisville Metro Parks. He's saving for college. He's off the corner. He's on a path.</p><p><strong>Alex's trajectory:</strong> Legitimate opportunities. Positive mentorship. Future with possibilities.</p><p><strong>THE BUDGET DIFFERENCE:</strong>
<li>After-school programs (3-7pm): $15M citywide (serving 15,000 youth daily)</li>
<li>Summer youth jobs: $12M (3,000 positions at $15/hour)</li>
<li>Mentorship programs: $8M (one-on-one support)</li>
<li><strong>Cost per Alex: ~$2,500/year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Savings if Alex avoids juvenile justice system: ~$150,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net result: 35% reduction in youth crime among program participants</strong></li></p><p>---</p><h2>EVENING: PUBLIC SAFETY EMERGENCY</h2><h3><strong>TANYA, Domestic Violence Victim in Buechel</strong></h3><h4>UNDER THE CURRENT BUDGET (Current Louisville):</h4><p><strong>8:00 PM</strong> - Tanya's boyfriend is drunk and violent at their apartment on Bardstown Road. This has happened before. She's terrified but doesn't know what to do. She has two young kids in the next room.</p><p><strong>8:30 PM</strong> - Neighbor calls 911. Two LMPD officers arrive. They separate Tanya and her boyfriend. He's arrested for assault. Officers mean well but they're not social workers. They tell Tanya about a domestic violence hotline and leave.</p><p><strong>9:00 PM</strong> - Tanya is alone with her kids in the apartment. Her boyfriend will be out on bail tomorrow. She has no family in Louisville. She doesn't know where to go. She's scared to go to a shelter - what about her job? Her kids' school?</p><p><strong>9:30 PM</strong> - Tanya knows he'll come back. The pattern will repeat. She feels trapped. The cycle of violence continues.</p><p><strong>Three months later</strong> - Another incident. This one worse. Tanya ends up in the ER. Kids are traumatized. Still no real help or resources.</p><p><strong>Tanya's situation:</strong> Crisis management. Band-aids. Cycle unbroken.</p><p>---</p><h4>UNDER BIGGERS' BUDGET (Prevention-First Louisville):</h4><p><strong>8:00 PM</strong> - Tanya's boyfriend is drunk and violent at their apartment. She's terrified. She has the crisis hotline number from the wellness center posted on her fridge.</p><p><strong>8:30 PM</strong> - She calls the crisis line. A trained domestic violence counselor answers and dispatches a co-responder team: one LMPD officer (Officer Chen) AND one social worker (Monica) who specializes in domestic violence.</p><p><strong>9:00 PM</strong> - The team arrives. Officer Chen handles the boyfriend (arrested for assault). Monica focuses on Tanya. She does a safety assessment, talks to the kids, explains options, and connects Tanya with emergency resources immediately.</p><p><strong>9:30 PM</strong> - Monica gets Tanya and the kids into emergency housing at a domestic violence shelter (bed available that night). She helps Tanya file for an emergency protective order. She connects Tanya with the wellness center's social worker who will help her navigate next steps: long-term housing, legal help, counseling.</p><p><strong>Next week</strong> - Tanya is in a safe apartment (subsidized through the program). She's in counseling for trauma. Her kids are seeing a child therapist. She has a safety plan. She's connected to legal aid. The cycle is broken.</p><p><strong>Three months later</strong> - Tanya has a protective order. She's working full-time. Her kids are stabilizing. She's not going back. She has support.</p><p><strong>Tanya's situation:</strong> Real help. Comprehensive support. New life possible.</p><p><strong>THE BUDGET DIFFERENCE:</strong>
<li>Co-responder teams (police + social worker): Part of $7M mental health crisis program</li>
<li>Wellness center social services: Part of $45M wellness investment</li>
<li>Domestic violence resources: Part of $7M social services budget</li>
<li><strong>Cost per intervention: ~$3,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Savings in reduced ER visits, court costs, long-term trauma: ~$25,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Net result: Lives saved, cycles broken</strong></li></p><p>---</p><h2>NIGHT: COMMUNITY SAFETY</h2><h3><strong>THE RESIDENTS OF SMOKETOWN</strong></h3><h4>UNDER THE CURRENT BUDGET (Current Louisville):</h4><p><strong>10:00 PM</strong> - Mrs. Williams, 68, hears noise outside her house on South Shelby Street. She's scared - there have been three break-ins on her block this month.</p><p><strong>10:15 PM</strong> - She calls 911. Wait time is 8 minutes (high call volume). Dispatch sends a patrol car from the division office on Liberty Street - 12 minutes away.</p><p><strong>10:30 PM</strong> - By the time the officer arrives, whoever was outside is long gone. Officer takes a report, drives around the block once, and leaves. Mrs. Williams can't sleep. She's considering moving, but she's lived in Smoketown for 40 years.</p><p><strong>11:00 PM</strong> - Quiet returns, but fear remains. The neighborhood doesn't know the officers who patrol. The officers don't know the residents. It's strangers policing strangers.</p><p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Reactive policing. No prevention. No relationships. Fear persists.</p><p>---</p><h4>UNDER BIGGERS' BUDGET (Prevention-First Louisville):</h4><p><strong>10:00 PM</strong> - Mrs. Williams hears noise outside. She looks out the window and sees Officer Hayes on foot patrol. He works from the mini substation on Breckenridge Street (two blocks away).</p><p><strong>10:05 PM</strong> - Officer Hayes sees the situation and approaches. He knows Mrs. Williams - they met at the community meeting last month. He recognizes the "suspicious person" - it's her neighbor's son, taking out the trash.</p><p><strong>10:10 PM</strong> - False alarm. Officer Hayes walks Mrs. Williams back to her door, makes sure she's okay. "Call the substation anytime, Mrs. Williams. We're here 24/7." She has the direct number posted on her fridge.</p><p><strong>10:30 PM</strong> - Officer Hayes continues his foot patrol. He's not just passing through - he works this neighborhood. He knows who belongs here and who doesn't. He knows which corner the kids hang out on. He knows Mr. Lewis on the corner is a veteran who sometimes has PTSD episodes.</p><p><strong>11:00 PM</strong> - Mrs. Williams sleeps better knowing Officer Hayes is out there. Crime in Smoketown is down 28% since the substation opened. She's not moving - her neighborhood is finally safe again.</p><p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Preventive policing. Real relationships. Trust built. Crime reduced.</p><p><strong>THE BUDGET DIFFERENCE:</strong>
<li>Mini substation in Smoketown: $650K annually (one of 46 across Louisville)</li>
<li>Officers on foot, not in cars, building relationships</li>
<li><strong>Same police budget: $245.9M</strong></li>
<li><strong>Different deployment: Community-based, not reactive</strong></li>
<li><strong>Result: 20-30% average crime reduction in neighborhoods with substations</strong></li></p><p>---</p><h2>COMPARISON SUMMARY</h2><h3>SAME BUDGET. DIFFERENT DAYS.</h3><p>| <strong>TIME</strong> | <strong>CURRENT LOUISVILLE</strong> | <strong>BIGGERS' LOUISVILLE</strong> |
