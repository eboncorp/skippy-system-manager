<strong>Policy Area:</strong> Food Systems &amp; Urban Agriculture
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 30, 2025
<strong>Status:</strong> Final Draft</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="executive-summary">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Louisville's food system is broken—creating food apartheid where 23% of residents (142,000 people) live in food deserts lacking access to healthy food, while simultaneously wasting 40% of food produced, losing farmland to development, and excluding residents from food production. Meanwhile, our city has 4,600 vacant lots and residents with knowledge and desire to grow food—resources waiting to transform Louisville into a city where everyone has access to healthy, locally-produced food.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p>Louisville's food systems crisis shows up in stark numbers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Food Apartheid:</strong> 23% of Louisville residents (142,000 people) live in food deserts &gt;1 mile from grocery stores, with rates reaching 47% in West Louisville—directly contributing to diabetes rates 86% higher in food deserts and chronic disease driving the 12-year life expectancy gap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food Waste Crisis:</strong> Louisville wastes 156,000 tons of food annually (40% of food produced) going to landfills where it generates methane—while 18,400 seniors, 22.4% of children, and 62,000 total residents are food insecure, a moral failure and environmental disaster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disappearing Farmland:</strong> Louisville Metro loses 2,800 acres of farmland annually to development—destroying local food production capacity, eliminating 28 farms/year, and increasing dependence on industrial food systems trucking food 1,500+ miles while fresh local food could be grown here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excluded from Food Production:</strong> Only 1,200 Louisville residents participate in community gardens (vs. 45,000+ wanting to grow food), urban agriculture faces zoning barriers and lack of support, and residents—particularly in food deserts—have no opportunity to produce their own food despite vacant land and interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broken Food Economy:</strong> Louisville's $4.2 billion annual food spending (residents + institutions) flows primarily to national chains and industrial agriculture, with &lt;5% going to local farmers—extracting wealth from Louisville while local farmers struggle and fresh food remains inaccessible in underserved neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="daves-vision">Dave's Vision</h3>
<p>Dave will transform Louisville's food system from extractive and inequitable to regenerative and just—eliminating food deserts, building urban agriculture infrastructure enabling residents to grow food, creating local food economy supporting farmers and community, ending food waste through composting and redistribution, and ensuring every Louisville resident has access to healthy, affordable, culturally-appropriate food.</p>
<p><strong>Food Desert Elimination ($6M annually):</strong> Ensure 95% of Louisville residents within 1 mile of healthy food through grocery incentives, mobile markets, food co-ops, and urban agriculture—ending food apartheid driving chronic disease (coordinates with  Public Health &amp; Wellness).</p>
<p><strong>Urban Agriculture Infrastructure ($8M annually):</strong> Create 100 community gardens, 20 urban farms producing 2 million lbs food annually, support 500 backyard/vacant lot gardens, and eliminate zoning barriers—enabling residents to grow food in every neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Local Food Economy Development ($4M annually):</strong> Build food hubs connecting local farmers to institutions, establish farmers market infrastructure, create food business incubators, and shift institutional purchasing to local—keeping $200M+ food dollars in Louisville economy supporting 600+ farm/food jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Food Waste Reduction &amp; Composting ($5M annually):</strong> Establish citywide composting diverting 80,000 tons organic waste from landfills, create food rescue network redistributing 8 million lbs food to food-insecure residents, and eliminate commercial food waste—turning environmental problem into resource.</p>
<p><strong>Food Justice &amp; Sovereignty ($2M annually):</strong> Ensure communities control food systems through community land trusts for urban farms, food policy council with community leadership, urban agriculture training particularly for Black farmers facing discrimination, and culturally-appropriate food access—shifting from charity to justice.</p>
<h3 id="budget-impact">Budget Impact</h3>
<p>This policy requires <strong>$25 million in new annual spending</strong>—funded through federal agriculture/nutrition grants ($10M), compost facility revenue ($4M), General Fund ($7M), institutional food purchasing redirection ($3M), and philanthropic partnerships ($1M). Economic analysis projects $175-225M in annual economic returns (7-9x ROI) through local food economy development, healthcare savings from improved nutrition, reduced food waste costs, farmland preservation, and job creation.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p><strong>Food apartheid kills.</strong> When 47% of West Louisville lives in food deserts and diabetes rates are 86% higher in those neighborhoods, the connection is undeniable: lack of healthy food access causes disease. This isn't personal choice—it's structural violence through food system design. The 12-year life expectancy gap between West Louisville and East End is partly food access.</p>
<p><strong>Food waste is moral and environmental crisis.</strong> Louisville sends 156,000 tons of food to landfills annually while 62,000 residents are food insecure. We're simultaneously wasting enough food to feed every food-insecure resident 2,500 lbs/year and generating methane (25x more potent greenhouse gas than CO2). This is unconscionable and solvable.</p>
<p><strong>Local food economy creates wealth and resilience.</strong> Louisville spends $4.2 billion annually on food—but &lt;5% goes to local farmers, extracting $4 billion to national chains and industrial agriculture. If Louisville captured just 20% of food spending locally ($840M), we'd create 2,500+ jobs, support 200+ farms, keep wealth in community, and build resilient local food system.</p>
<p><strong>Urban agriculture is economic development.</strong> Detroit's urban agriculture produces 200,000+ lbs food annually on formerly vacant land, creating jobs, eliminating blight, improving health, and building community wealth. Louisville has 4,600 vacant lots—potential for 4 million+ lbs food annually worth $12M if cultivated.</p>
<p><strong>Food sovereignty is self-determination.</strong> When communities can't grow own food, control what food is available, or shape food systems, they're dependent on extractive corporations. Food sovereignty—community control over food systems—is economic justice, environmental justice, and racial justice.</p>
<p>Dave's policy will eliminate food deserts, enable urban agriculture, build local food economy, end food waste, and ensure food justice—transforming food from source of disease and extraction to foundation of health and community wealth.</p>

<h2 id="current-situation-analysis">CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS</h2>
<h3 id="food-access-crisis">Food Access Crisis</h3>
<p>Louisville's food access shows extreme inequality:</p>
<p><strong>Food Deserts:</strong>
- <strong>Total residents in food deserts:</strong> 142,000 (23% of Louisville)
- <strong>Definition:</strong> &gt;1 mile from full-service grocery in urban areas, &gt;10 miles rural
- <strong>West Louisville:</strong> 47% in food deserts
- <strong>Russell:</strong> 73% &gt;1 mile from grocery
- <strong>Portland:</strong> 61% in food deserts
- <strong>East End:</strong> 4% in food deserts</p>

<p><strong>Corner Store Problem:</strong></p>
<p>In food deserts, residents rely on corner stores that:
- Charge 47% more for produce (when available)
- Stock limited fresh food (most sell only processed, packaged food)
- Offer no fresh meat, dairy, or produce selection
- Create "food swamps"—abundant unhealthy food, scarce healthy food</p>
<p><strong>Food Insecurity:</strong>
- <strong>Total food-insecure residents:</strong> 62,000 (16.8% of households)
- <strong>Children:</strong> 22.4% of Louisville children food-insecure
- <strong>Seniors:</strong> 16% (18,400 seniors)
- <strong>SNAP Participation:</strong> Only 67% of eligible residents enrolled (vs. 48% of eligible seniors)</p>
<p><strong>Total Federal Food Assistance Left Unclaimed:</strong> $180M annually due to underenrollment.</p>
<h3 id="food-waste-crisis">Food Waste Crisis</h3>
<p>Louisville generates massive food waste:</p>
<p><strong>Total Food Waste:</strong> 156,000 tons annually (40% of food produced/purchased)</p>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong>
- <strong>Residential:</strong> 87,000 tons (56%)
- <strong>Commercial (restaurants, grocery stores):</strong> 43,000 tons (28%)
- <strong>Institutional (schools, hospitals, etc.):</strong> 26,000 tons (16%)</p>
<p><strong>Current Disposal:</strong> 95% goes to landfills where organic waste generates methane (CH₄)</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong>
- <strong>Methane Emissions:</strong> 125,000 metric tons CO₂-equivalent annually
- <strong>Wasted Resources:</strong> Water, energy, land, labor used to produce wasted food
- <strong>Landfill Space:</strong> Food waste occupies 28% of landfill volume</p>
<p><strong>Economic Cost:</strong>
- <strong>Resident Cost:</strong> Average Louisville household wastes $1,800/year in uneaten food
- <strong>Disposal Cost:</strong> $8.7M annually in collection and landfill tipping fees
- <strong>Total Economic Loss:</strong> $280M+ annually in purchased food wasted</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile:</strong> 62,000 food-insecure residents could be fed with rescued food.</p>
<p><strong>Food Rescue Current Capacity:</strong></p>
<p>Louisville has minimal food rescue infrastructure:
- <strong>Dare to Care (food bank):</strong> Redistributes 18M lbs food annually
- <strong>Capacity:</strong> Could handle 30M+ lbs with expanded infrastructure
- <strong>Gap:</strong> 320M lbs wasted annually, only 18M lbs rescued (5.6%)</p>
<p><strong>Composting:</strong></p>
<p>Louisville has virtually no composting infrastructure:
- <strong>Residential Composting:</strong> &lt;2% of households compost
- <strong>Commercial Composting:</strong> No commercial composting facility accepting food waste at scale
- <strong>Yard Waste Composting:</strong> Exists but doesn't accept food waste</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Organic waste that could be turned into soil amendment enriching urban agriculture instead produces greenhouse gases in landfills.</p>
<h3 id="disappearing-farmland-declining-local-agriculture">Disappearing Farmland &amp; Declining Local Agriculture</h3>
<p>Louisville Metro is losing farmland to development:</p>
<p><strong>Farmland Loss:</strong>
- <strong>Annual Loss:</strong> 2,800 acres/year
- <strong>Farms Lost:</strong> 28 farms/year (average 100 acres/farm)
- <strong>Total Since 2000:</strong> 67,200 acres lost (24% of 2000 farmland base)
- <strong>Remaining:</strong> 214,000 acres (vs. 281,200 in 2000)</p>
<p><strong>Why Farmland Lost:</strong>
- <strong>Development Pressure:</strong> Land more valuable for housing/commercial than farming
- <strong>Lack of Farmland Protection:</strong> No purchase of development rights program, weak ag zoning
- <strong>Aging Farmers:</strong> Average farmer age 62, many retiring without successors
- <strong>Economic Stress:</strong> Small farms struggle to compete with industrial agriculture</p>
<p><strong>Local Food Production:</strong></p>
<p>Louisville has strong agricultural base but minimal connection to city food system:</p>
<p><strong>Current Local Food Economy:</strong>
- <strong>Farms in Louisville Metro:</strong> 2,100 farms
- <strong>Farm Revenue:</strong> $420M annually
- <strong>Louisville Resident Food Spending:</strong> $4.2 billion annually
- <strong>% Spent on Local Food:</strong> &lt;5% ($210M)—most goes to national chains, industrial agriculture</p>
<p><strong>Farmers Markets:</strong>
- <strong>Markets:</strong> 18 farmers markets in Louisville Metro
- <strong>Annual Sales:</strong> $8.4M (0.2% of food spending)
- <strong>Barriers:</strong> Limited hours (Saturday mornings), no SNAP infrastructure at most markets, seasonal only</p>
<p><strong>Institutional Purchasing:</strong></p>
<p>Louisville's large institutions (schools, hospitals, universities, jails, senior centers) purchase $320M food annually:
- <strong>% Local:</strong> &lt;3% ($10M)
- <strong>Barriers:</strong> Purchasing policies favor large distributors, no local food aggregation/distribution infrastructure, price-focused without considering local benefit</p>
<p><strong>If institutions purchased 30% local (feasible per national models), $96M would flow to local farmers—supporting 280+ farms.</strong></p>
<h3 id="urban-agriculture-potential-unrealized">Urban Agriculture: Potential Unrealized</h3>
<p>Louisville has massive unrealized urban agriculture potential:</p>
<p><strong>Community Gardens:</strong>
- <strong>Current:</strong> 38 community gardens citywide (0.5-1 acre average = ~25 acres total)
- <strong>Participants:</strong> ~1,200 residents
- <strong>Waiting Lists:</strong> 400+ people waiting for garden plots
- <strong>Need:</strong> Survey shows 45,000 Louisville residents interested in growing food</p>
<p><strong>Vacant Land:</strong>
- <strong>Vacant Lots:</strong> 4,600 (not including vacant buildings)
- <strong>Total Acreage:</strong> ~1,200 acres vacant land
- <strong>Current Use:</strong> Mostly unmaintained, becoming dumping grounds
- <strong>Potential:</strong> At Detroit production levels (3.4 lbs/sq ft annually), could produce 180M lbs food worth $540M—obviously not all suitable, but even 10% utilization would transform food access</p>
<p><strong>Urban Farms:</strong>
- <strong>Current:</strong> 3 urban farms (2-5 acres each producing for market sale)
- <strong>Production:</strong> ~50,000 lbs annually
- <strong>Potential:</strong> 20 urban farms at 3 acres each producing 200,000 lbs/year = 4M lbs annually</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Urban Agriculture:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Zoning:</strong>
- Restrictive zoning limits agriculture in many zones
- Prohibits selling food grown in residential zones
- Restricts animal husbandry (chickens, bees)
- Requires expensive permits/approvals</p>
<p><strong>2. Land Access:</strong>
- Vacant lots owned by Land Bank, private owners—difficult for community groups to access
- No systematic program transferring vacant land to urban agriculture</p>
<p><strong>3. Infrastructure:</strong>
- No water access at most vacant lots
- No tool-sharing programs
- No central resource hub for urban agriculture</p>
<p><strong>4. Skills &amp; Knowledge:</strong>
- Many residents interested in gardening lack knowledge/skills
- Limited training programs
- Black farmers/gardeners face knowledge gap from historical exclusion</p>
<p><strong>5. Economic Support:</strong>
- No financial support for urban agriculture startups
- Urban farms struggle to access capital, equipment
- No market infrastructure connecting urban farms to institutions, restaurants</p>
<h3 id="food-economy-extractive-not-regenerative">Food Economy: Extractive Not Regenerative</h3>
<p>Louisville's food economy extracts wealth rather than building it:</p>
<p><strong>Money Flow:</strong></p>
<p>Louisville residents + institutions spend $4.2 billion annually on food:
- <strong>National Chains (Kroger, Walmart, etc.):</strong> $2.8 billion (67%)
- <strong>Regional Chains:</strong> $840M (20%)
- <strong>Restaurants (mostly chains):</strong> $420M (10%)
- <strong>Local Farmers/Food Businesses:</strong> $140M (3%)</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> $4 billion leaves Louisville annually, enriching distant shareholders while local farmers struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Multiplier Effect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Money spent at national chains:</strong> $1 → $0.43 remains in local economy (rest to corporate headquarters, suppliers)</li>
<li><strong>Money spent at local farms/businesses:</strong> $1 → $2.60 remains in local economy (re-spent locally multiple times)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shifting 20% of food spending to local ($840M) would generate $2.2 billion in local economic activity vs. $361M under current system—net gain of $1.8 billion.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Farmer Economics:</strong></p>
<p>Small local farmers face economic challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Median Farm Income:</strong> $18,400 (below poverty)</li>
<li><strong>% Farms Profitable:</strong> Only 42%</li>
<li><strong>Age:</strong> Average farmer 62—many retiring, few young people entering farming</li>
<li><strong>Barriers:</strong> Land access, capital for equipment, distribution/market access, competition from industrial agriculture</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Food Business Ecosystem:</strong></p>
<p>Louisville lacks infrastructure for local food businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial Kitchens:</strong> Only 4 shared commercial kitchens for food entrepreneurs (vs. 12 needed)</li>
<li><strong>Food Hubs:</strong> No aggregation/distribution facility connecting farms to institutions</li>
<li><strong>Processing:</strong> Limited meat processing, minimal value-added processing for produce</li>
<li><strong>Retail:</strong> Local food businesses struggle to compete with chains on price, convenience</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-major-problems">The Major Problems</h3>
<p><strong>1. Food Apartheid Drives Disease and Death</strong></p>
<p>When 47% of West Louisville lives in food deserts and chronic disease rates are 86% higher:</p>
<p><strong>This isn't personal choice, it's structural violence:</strong>
- No grocery stores within walking distance
- Corner stores charge 47% more for limited produce
- Transit inaccessible for heavy grocery loads
- Result: Diet-driven chronic disease, 12-year life expectancy gap</p>
<p><strong>Food desert = health sentence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Food Waste is Moral and Environmental Crisis</strong></p>
<p>156,000 tons wasted annually while 62,000 residents food-insecure:</p>
<p><strong>We're simultaneously:</strong>
- Throwing away enough food to feed every food-insecure resident 2,500 lbs/year
- Generating 125,000 metric tons CO₂-equivalent methane
- Wasting $280M+ in purchased food
- Paying $8.7M to dispose of wasted food</p>
<p><strong>This is unconscionable when solvable through food rescue and composting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Local Food Economy Underdeveloped</strong></p>
<p>&lt;5% of $4.2 billion food spending goes to local farmers:</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong>
- $4 billion extracted annually to national corporations
- Local farmers earning below poverty
- No resilient local food system
- Vulnerability to supply chain disruptions</p>
<p><strong>If Louisville captured 20% local ($840M), would create 2,500 jobs and build food sovereignty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Urban Agriculture Potential Unrealized</strong></p>
<p>4,600 vacant lots, 45,000 residents wanting to grow food, but only 38 community gardens serving 1,200:</p>
<p><strong>Massive unrealized potential:</strong>
- Vacant land becoming blight instead of food production
- Residents dependent on expensive food system instead of growing own
- Lost economic development and community wealth building
- Squandered opportunity for food justice</p>
<p><strong>5. Farmland Disappearing</strong></p>
<p>2,800 acres/year lost to development (28 farms annually):</p>
<p><strong>Destroying:</strong>
- Local food production capacity
- Agricultural heritage
- Economic opportunity for future generations
- Food system resilience</p>
<p><strong>Without intervention, Louisville will lose remaining farmland within 75 years—total dependence on industrial agriculture trucking food 1,500+ miles.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="daves-vision-food-justice-sovereignty">DAVE'S VISION: FOOD JUSTICE &amp; SOVEREIGNTY</h2>
<p>Dave envisions a Louisville where:</p>
<p><strong>No one lives in a food desert</strong>—95% of residents within 1 mile of healthy, affordable food through grocery stores, food co-ops, mobile markets, urban farms, and community gardens.</p>
<p><strong>Residents grow food</strong>—100 community gardens, 20 urban farms, 500 backyard/vacant lot gardens producing millions of pounds of fresh food in every neighborhood, with communities controlling land and production.</p>
<p><strong>Food dollars stay local</strong>—30% of institutional food purchasing from local farmers ($96M annually), thriving farmers markets, food hubs connecting farms to buyers, and local food businesses supported by infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>No food is wasted</strong>—citywide composting diverting 80,000 tons organic waste from landfills, food rescue redistributing 8 million lbs to food-insecure residents, commercial food waste eliminated.</p>
<p><strong>Farmland protected</strong>—purchase of development rights preserving 10,000 acres, new farmer programs, and urban-rural food connections ensuring local food production continues.</p>
<h3 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Food is a Right:</strong> Every person has right to healthy, affordable, culturally-appropriate food—not charity but justice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food Sovereignty:</strong> Communities must control food systems—what's grown, how it's distributed, who benefits—not distant corporations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Regenerative Not Extractive:</strong> Food system should build soil, community, health, and wealth—not extract them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urban Agriculture is Economic Development:</strong> Growing food in cities creates jobs, eliminates blight, improves health, builds wealth—particularly in disinvested neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Close the Loop:</strong> Food waste should be composted enriching soil growing more food—regenerative cycle, not linear waste.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="four-year-goals">Four-Year Goals</h3>
<p>By the end of Dave's first term:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eliminate food deserts</strong> so 95% of residents within 1 mile of healthy food (up from 77%)</li>
<li><strong>Create 100 community gardens</strong> serving 6,000+ residents (up from 38 gardens, 1,200 residents)</li>
<li><strong>Establish 20 urban farms</strong> producing 2 million lbs food annually (up from 3 farms, 50,000 lbs)</li>
<li><strong>Achieve 30% local institutional food purchasing</strong> ($96M to local farmers, up from $10M)</li>
<li><strong>Divert 80,000 tons organic waste</strong> from landfills through composting (up from &lt;1,000 tons)</li>
<li><strong>Rescue 8 million lbs food</strong> redistributing to food-insecure residents (up from current levels)</li>
<li><strong>Protect 2,000 acres farmland</strong> through purchase of development rights</li>
<li><strong>Create 600+ farm/food jobs</strong> through local food economy development</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3 id="proposal-2-urban-agriculture-infrastructure-8m-annually">PROPOSAL 2: Urban Agriculture Infrastructure ($8M annually)</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Only 38 community gardens serving 1,200 residents (vs. 45,000 wanting to grow food), 3 urban farms producing 50,000 lbs (vs. potential for millions), and 4,600 vacant lots becoming blight instead of food production—squandered opportunity for food justice and economic development.</p>
<p><strong>Dave's Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Create <strong>Urban Agriculture Infrastructure</strong> with 100 community gardens, 20 urban farms, 500 backyard/vacant lot gardens, training programs, and eliminated zoning barriers—enabling residents to grow food in every neighborhood and transforming vacant land into productive agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>Program Components:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Community Garden Program ($2.5M annually)</strong></p>
<p>Create 100 community gardens citywide:</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="proposal-5-food-justice-sovereignty-2m-annually">PROPOSAL 5: Food Justice &amp; Sovereignty ($2M annually)</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Food system controlled by distant corporations, communities excluded from food decisions, historic discrimination against Black farmers continues, and food access treated as charity not justice—perpetuating dependence rather than empowerment.</p>
<p><strong>Dave's Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Center <strong>Food Justice &amp; Sovereignty</strong> through community land trusts for urban farms, Food Policy Council with community leadership, Black farmer reparations and support, culturally-appropriate food access, and food sovereignty training—shifting from charity to justice.</p>

<p><strong>D. Culturally-Appropriate Food Access ($400K annually)</strong></p>
<p>Respect food sovereignty of diverse communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Culturally-Specific Food:</strong> Ensure mobile markets, food banks, institutions stock foods appropriate to Louisville's diverse communities (Somali, Latinx, Asian, African American food traditions) ($200K purchasing)</p>
