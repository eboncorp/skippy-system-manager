<h2 id="executive-summary">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Louisville is falling behind peer cities in the technology economy and digital infrastructure that drive 21st-century prosperity. While cities like Indianapolis, Nashville, and Austin have built thriving tech sectors through strategic public investment—creating tens of thousands of high-wage jobs and attracting billions in venture capital—Louisville's tech economy remains underdeveloped, our residents face a persistent digital divide, and our city government operates on outdated technology that fails to serve residents effectively.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p>Louisville's technology and innovation crisis shows up in stark numbers:</p>
<ol>
<li>**Underdevelo</li>
</ol>
<p>ped Tech Economy:** Louisville's tech sector represents just 3.2% of total employment (vs. 7.8% in Austin, 6.4% in Nashville, 5.1% in Indianapolis)—missing out on an industry where jobs pay 85% above median wage and grew 25% nationally over the past decade.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Digital Divide:</strong> 91,000 Louisville households (24% of total) lack broadband internet access—with rates reaching 47% in West Louisville neighborhoods—excluding residents from remote work, online education, telehealth, and essential government services increasingly delivered digitally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tech Workforce Gap:</strong> Louisville produces 850 tech graduates annually from UofL, Bellarmine, and Jefferson Community College—but loses 58% of them within 5 years to cities offering better tech job opportunities, venture capital access, and innovation ecosystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outdated Government Technology:</strong> Louisville Metro's technology infrastructure is 8-12 years behind peer cities, with residents facing 45-minute average wait times for city services, paper-based processes that should be digital, and no unified digital platform for accessing government—while peer cities offer mobile apps, online permitting, and AI-powered service delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of Innovation Infrastructure:</strong> Louisville has zero city-funded tech incubators (vs. 7 in Nashville, 4 in Indianapolis), minimal venture capital ($47M annually vs. Nashville's $3.2B), and no comprehensive strategy to build tech ecosystem—ensuring we remain locked out of the innovation economy driving prosperity elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="daves-vision">Dave's Vision</h3>
<p>Dave will transform Louisville into a city where technology drives equitable economic development, every resident has access to high-speed internet, city government operates on modern digital infrastructure that serves residents efficiently, and our innovation ecosystem creates pathways to high-wage tech careers for Louisville residents—not just transplants from coastal cities.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Broadband Initiative ($15M annually):</strong> Ensure every Louisville household has access to affordable high-speed internet through municipal broadband expansion, digital equity programs, and partnerships—eliminating the digital divide that excludes 91,000 households from economic opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Louisville Innovation District ($8M annually):</strong> Establish innovation district in West Louisville with tech incubators, co-working spaces, maker spaces, and entrepreneurship support—creating 2,000+ tech jobs over 4 years and ensuring innovation economy benefits historically excluded communities.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Talent Pipeline ($6M annually):</strong> Create comprehensive pathway from K-12 computer science education through coding bootcamps, apprenticeships, and career placement—training 1,000+ Louisville residents annually for tech careers and retaining local graduates.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Government Transformation ($7M annually):</strong> Modernize city technology infrastructure with mobile apps, online services, digital permitting, AI-powered assistance, and unified data systems—reducing wait times from 45 minutes to under 5 minutes and making government accessible 24/7.</p>
<p><strong>Civic Technology &amp; Open Data ($2M annually):</strong> Release all non-sensitive city data publicly, support civic tech projects addressing community challenges, and fund technology solutions developed by and for Louisville residents—democratizing innovation.</p>
<h3 id="budget-impact">Budget Impact</h3>
<p>This policy requires <strong>$38 million in new annual spending</strong>—funded through federal broadband grants ($15M), General Fund allocation ($10M), revenue bonds for digital infrastructure ($8M), and partnerships/philanthropy ($5M). Economic analysis projects $266-380M in annual economic returns (7-10x ROI) through tech job creation, productivity gains, business attraction, and cost savings from government efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p><strong>The digital divide is the new economic divide.</strong> When 91,000 Louisville households lack internet access, those families are excluded from remote work opportunities, online education, telehealth, and government services. During COVID-19, students without internet fell 6-12 months behind—a learning loss many will never recover. This isn't about convenience, it's about economic survival.</p>
<p><strong>Tech jobs are the highest-wage, fastest-growing sector—and we're missing out.</strong> The median tech job pays $89,000 vs. Louisville's median wage $59,200. Nashville's tech sector has grown 187% over 10 years, creating 45,000 jobs paying $4.1 billion in annual wages. Louisville's tech sector grew just 31% over the same period—we're falling further behind every year we don't invest.</p>
<p><strong>Outdated government technology costs residents time and money.</strong> When Louisville residents spend 45 minutes on hold for city services, wait weeks for permits that should take hours, and drive to government offices for transactions that should be online—that's time away from work, lost productivity, and a tax on low-income residents who can least afford it.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation drives 21st-century competitiveness.</strong> Cities attracting talent and investment are those with vibrant innovation ecosystems—tech incubators, venture capital, startup culture, maker spaces. Louisville's lack of innovation infrastructure ensures we lose talent to cities that invest—and fall behind in industries defining the future economy.</p>
<p>Dave's policy will close the digital divide, build a thriving tech sector, modernize government, and create pathways to high-wage tech careers for Louisville residents. It's about ensuring technology serves everyone, not just the already-connected and affluent.</p>

<h3 id="the-major-problems">The Major Problems</h3>
<p><strong>1. Digital Divide Perpetuates Economic Inequality</strong></p>
<p>91,000 households without broadband are systematically excluded from economic opportunity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job Access:</strong> 67% of jobs require online applications—excluding those without internet</li>
<li><strong>Remote Work:</strong> Fastest-growing job category (22% annual growth) requires broadband—those without internet locked out</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Students without internet fall behind, less likely to attend college, earn lower lifetime wages</li>
<li><strong>Small Business:</strong> Businesses without broadband can't compete—increasingly reliant on digital marketing, e-commerce, cloud tools</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Without intervention, digital divide will widen as more economic activity moves online.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Underdeveloped Tech Economy Means Lost High-Wage Jobs</strong></p>
<p>Every year Louisville fails to build tech ecosystem, we lose high-wage job opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wage Premium:</strong> Median tech job pays $89,400 vs. $59,200 city median—30% premium</li>
<li><strong>Job Growth:</strong> Tech jobs grew 25% nationally over past decade—Louisville's 31% growth lags substantially behind Nashville (142%), Austin (187%)</li>
<li><strong>Brain Drain:</strong> Losing 493 tech graduates annually means losing $43.8M in annual wages ($89,400 × 493) to other cities—and all the spending/tax revenue those wages would generate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If Louisville matched Indianapolis tech employment (5.1% vs. current 3.2%), we'd have 12,100 additional tech jobs paying $1.08 billion in additional annual wages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Outdated Government Technology Wastes Time and Money</strong></p>
<p>Every day Louisville operates on 1990s technology, residents and city pay the price:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resident Time:</strong> 285,000 hours annually wasted waiting for city services (worth $6.8M)</li>
<li><strong>City Productivity:</strong> $24M annually wasted on manual tasks that should be automated</li>
<li><strong>Economic Delay:</strong> $15-25M in annual economic impact lost to slow permitting, outdated systems</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity Risk:</strong> Outdated systems vulnerable to ransomware (like 2019 Baltimore attack costing $18M)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total annual cost of technology deficit: $45-56M—more than what investment in modernization would cost.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Lack of Innovation Infrastructure Prevents Startup Growth</strong></p>
<p>Without incubators, venture capital, and ecosystem support, Louisville startups can't scale:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VC Gap:</strong> Louisville receives $47M annually in venture capital vs. Nashville's $3.2B—68x difference</li>
<li><strong>Startup Failure:</strong> 73% of Louisville startups fail within 5 years (vs. 61% in cities with robust incubator ecosystems)</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Mismatch:</strong> Louisville's lone tech incubator is in East End—requiring car access, excluding West Louisville entrepreneurs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Great ideas born in Louisville get developed elsewhere, taking jobs and tax revenue to other cities.</p>
<p><strong>5. Tech Workforce Excludes People of Color and Women</strong></p>
<p>Louisville's tech sector replicates national diversity crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 7% of tech workers are Black (vs. 24% city population)</li>
<li>Only 23% are women (vs. 51% population)</li>
<li>Median Black tech worker earns 18% less than white counterpart in same role</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Without intervention, tech economy will be another sector where prosperity bypasses communities of color.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="daves-vision-technology-that-serves-everyone">DAVE'S VISION: TECHNOLOGY THAT SERVES EVERYONE</h2>
<p>Dave envisions a Louisville where:</p>
<p><strong>Every household</strong> has access to affordable high-speed internet, eliminating the digital divide that excludes 91,000 families from economic opportunity, online education, telehealth, and full participation in 21st-century society.</p>
<p><strong>Technology creates pathways to prosperity</strong> for Louisville residents—particularly people of color and residents of historically excluded neighborhoods—with comprehensive training from K-12 computer science through coding bootcamps and tech apprenticeships leading to careers paying $80,000+.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation happens everywhere</strong>, with tech incubators, maker spaces, and co-working spaces in West Louisville, the South End, and every neighborhood—not just the East End—ensuring all communities can participate in building the future.</p>
<p><strong>City government operates on 21st-century technology</strong>, with mobile apps, online services, AI-powered assistance, and unified data systems that make accessing government easy, fast, and available 24/7—not a frustrating ordeal requiring hours of wait time and in-person visits.</p>
<p><strong>Louisville's tech sector rivals peer cities</strong>, attracting venture capital, retaining talented graduates, creating thousands of high-wage jobs, and establishing Louisville as an innovation hub—not a place tech talent flees.</p>
<h3 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Universal Access:</strong> High-speed internet is infrastructure as essential as water and electricity—no Louisville resident should be excluded from digital economy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equity-Centered Innovation:</strong> Technology investment must prioritize historically excluded communities—tech economy shouldn't replicate patterns where prosperity concentrates in wealthy white neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Residents First:</strong> Technology should serve Louisville residents' needs, not Silicon Valley investors—we'll fund solutions to our community challenges, not copycat startups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open &amp; Transparent:</strong> City data and technology should be open and accessible to residents—enabling transparency, accountability, and civic innovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Workforce Development:</strong> Tech investment must include comprehensive pathways for Louisville residents to access tech careers—not just importing talent from elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="four-year-goals">Four-Year Goals</h3>
<p>By the end of Dave's first term:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achieve 95%+ broadband access</strong> (up from 76%), eliminating digital divide</li>
<li><strong>Create 2,000+ new tech jobs</strong> at median wage $85,000+ (adding $170M in annual wages)</li>

<h2 id="detailed-policy-proposals">DETAILED POLICY PROPOSALS</h2>
<h3 id="proposal-1-universal-broadband-initiative-15m-annually">PROPOSAL 1: Universal Broadband Initiative ($15M annually)</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> 91,000 Louisville households (24%) lack broadband internet access—with rates reaching 47% in West Louisville—excluding residents from remote work, online education, telehealth, and essential government services. This digital divide perpetuates economic inequality and will only worsen as more of economy moves online.</p>
<p><strong>Dave's Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Launch <strong>Universal Broadband Initiative</strong> to ensure every Louisville household has access to affordable high-speed internet through municipal broadband expansion, digital equity programs, subsidies, and public-private partnerships—eliminating the digital divide within 4 years.</p>
<p><strong>Program Components:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Municipal Broadband Expansion ($8M annually)</strong></p>
<p>Build municipal broadband network in underserved neighborhoods where private ISPs won't invest:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiber Network Construction:</strong> Deploy fiber-optic network in West Louisville, Russell, Portland, Smoketown, South End neighborhoods with &lt;60% broadband access ($25M capital investment over 3 years, $8M annually in Year 1-3, leveraging $75M federal broadband grants)</li>
<li><strong>Service Area:</strong> Target 45,000 households in underserved neighborhoods</li>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> $40/month for 100 Mbps symmetrical service (vs. $70-90 for equivalent private service)—with $10/month reduced rate for households earning &lt;150% federal poverty level</li>
<li><strong>Public Ownership:</strong> Network owned by Louisville Metro, operated through partnership/contract—ensuring long-term affordability and community control</li>
<li><strong>Wireless Coverage:</strong> Free public Wi-Fi in 50 high-traffic public spaces (libraries, community centers, parks, transit hubs) for those who can't afford home service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Model:</strong> Chattanooga municipal fiber (serving 180,000 households) generates $60M annual economic impact and attracts tech businesses—while keeping prices 30-40% below private ISPs.</p>
<p><strong>B. Digital Equity Program ($4M annually)</strong></p>
<p>Beyond infrastructure, address barriers to digital adoption:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device Program:</strong> Provide free refurbished laptops/tablets to 5,000 low-income households annually ($1.5M—average $300/device through partnerships with tech companies, universities donating surplus equipment)</li>
<li><strong>Digital Literacy Training:</strong> Free classes at libraries, community centers teaching basic computer skills, internet safety, online job applications, telehealth access—serving 8,000 residents annually ($1M)</li>
<li><strong>Tech Support:</strong> Establish digital navigator program with 30 community members trained to provide in-home tech support for seniors, immigrants, and others struggling with technology ($900K—$30K/navigator)</li>
<li><strong>Affordable Service Partnerships:</strong> Negotiate with private ISPs to offer $15/month low-income internet plans (leveraging federal Affordable Connectivity Program)—connecting 15,000 households annually ($600K in outreach/enrollment support)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C. Broadband for Multifamily Housing ($2M annually)</strong></p>
<p>Address unique barriers in apartment buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Building Upgrades:</strong> Grants for apartment building owners to install broadband infrastructure in buildings lacking connectivity ($1.2M annually, 40 buildings serving 2,500 units)</li>
<li><strong>Public Housing:</strong> Ensure all Louisville Metro Housing Authority properties have broadband infrastructure and subsidized service ($500K annually)</li>
<li><strong>Tenant Protection:</strong> Prohibit landlords from exclusive ISP agreements that limit tenant choice and drive up prices—enforce competition</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D. School &amp; Library Connectivity ($1M annually)</strong></p>
<p>Extend broadband beyond school buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Homework Hotspots:</strong> Provide mobile hotspots to 2,000 JCPS students annually lacking home internet ($600K)</li>
<li><strong>Library Hours Extension:</strong> Fund extended library hours (including evenings/weekends) to provide internet access when working families can use it ($300K)</li>
<li><strong>Community Center Wi-Fi:</strong> Ensure all community centers have high-speed Wi-Fi available free to residents ($100K)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation Timeline:</strong>
- <strong>Months 1-6:</strong> Apply for federal broadband grants, conduct network design for municipal fiber, begin ISP negotiations for affordable plans
- <strong>Months 7-12:</strong> Award construction contracts, begin fiber deployment in first 3 neighborhoods, launch device program and digital literacy training
- <strong>Year 2:</strong> Municipal fiber operational in 15 neighborhoods serving 15,000 households, 10,000 devices distributed, 16,000 residents trained
- <strong>Year 3:</strong> Fiber expansion to additional 20 neighborhoods serving 30,000 additional households, total 45,000 connected to municipal network
- <strong>Year 4:</strong> 95%+ broadband access achieved citywide, ongoing affordability and digital equity programs</p>
<p><strong>Success Metrics:</strong>
- Broadband access rate (Target: 95% by Year 4, up from 76%)
- Access rate in underserved neighborhoods (Target: 85% in West Louisville, up from 53%)
- Municipal fiber households connected (Target: 45,000 by Year 4)
- Devices distributed (Target: 20,000 over 4 years)
- Digital literacy training participants (Target: 32,000 over 4 years)
- Median broadband cost (Target: 25% reduction through municipal competition)</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
<h3 id="1-why-should-taxpayers-fund-free-internet-when-private-companies-already-provide-it">1. Why should taxpayers fund free internet when private companies already provide it?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Because 91,000 Louisville households can't afford private internet, excluding them from jobs, education, healthcare, and government services. Internet is infrastructure as essential as roads or water—no one should be locked out of the digital economy.</p>
<p><strong>The market has failed:</strong>
- Private ISPs won't invest in low-income neighborhoods (not profitable enough)
- Prices are 30-40% higher than in cities with municipal competition
- 47% of West Louisville lacks broadband—after decades of "market solutions"</p>
<p><strong>Municipal broadband works:</strong>
- <strong>Chattanooga:</strong> Municipal fiber serving 180,000 households has generated $2.69 billion in economic impact—$1B in business attraction alone
- <strong>Wilson, NC:</strong> City-owned broadband in low-income community has achieved 94% adoption, created 200 jobs
- <strong>Lafayette, LA:</strong> Residents save average $600/year vs. private ISPs</p>
<p><strong>Return on investment:</strong> Every $1 invested in municipal broadband returns $4-8 in economic activity through remote work enablement, business growth, property value increases. This isn't charity—it's economic development with proven ROI.</p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong> Municipal broadband becomes revenue-positive within 3-5 years, generating income for city while lowering prices for residents. It pays for itself.</p>
<h3 id="2-louisville-isnt-austin-or-san-franciscowhy-try-to-compete-in-technology-when-we-should-focus-on-our-strengths-like-manufacturing-and-logistics">2. Louisville isn't Austin or San Francisco—why try to compete in technology when we should focus on our strengths like manufacturing and logistics?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Technology isn't replacing Louisville's traditional strengths—it's enhancing them. Modern manufacturing IS technology (automation, robotics, AI). Logistics IS technology (UPS, one of Louisville's largest employers, is a tech company as much as logistics). Every industry now depends on technology.</p>
<p><strong>The data:</strong>
- 67% of manufacturing jobs now require digital skills
- Logistics/supply chain management increasingly driven by AI, data analytics, automation
- Healthcare (another Louisville strength) depends on health IT, telemedicine, data analytics</p>
<p><strong>We're not choosing tech INSTEAD of traditional sectors—we're ensuring Louisville workers have skills for modern versions of those sectors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong> Tech sector has highest wage premiums and fastest growth:
- Median tech wage $89,400 vs. $59,200 city median—51% premium
- Tech jobs grew 25% nationally over decade vs. 12% overall job growth
- Tech skills increasingly required for middle-class jobs across ALL industries</p>
<p><strong>If Louisville doesn't invest in tech economy, we'll fall further behind peer cities</strong> like Nashville (142% tech growth) and Indianapolis (78% tech growth) that ARE investing—losing young talent and high-wage jobs to cities making technology a priority.</p>
<h3 id="3-wont-municipal-broadband-compete-unfairly-with-private-internet-providers-and-hurt-local-businesses">3. Won't municipal broadband compete unfairly with private internet providers and hurt local businesses?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Municipal broadband creates competition that HELPS consumers and businesses through lower prices and better service—while typically serving neighborhoods private ISPs have abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>Fair competition:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Municipal broadband targets underserved areas</strong> where private ISPs won't invest (not profitable)—we're filling gaps, not competing in well-served markets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private ISPs can compete on service, features, bundles</strong>—they just can't charge monopoly prices anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When municipal broadband enters market, private ISPs lower prices and improve service</strong>—benefiting even customers who don't switch to municipal option</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Evidence from peer cities:</strong>
- <strong>Chattanooga:</strong> After municipal fiber launched, Comcast LOWERED prices 30% and INCREASED speeds to compete—private ISP customers benefited even without switching
- <strong>Lafayette, LA:</strong> Private ISP prices dropped 22% after municipal broadband launch
- <strong>Wilson, NC:</strong> Time Warner expanded service to previously ignored rural areas after city launched municipal network</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Municipal broadband creates competitive market benefiting all consumers—vs. current situation where private ISPs have monopoly power to charge high prices for mediocre service.</p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong> Private ISPs receive billions in public subsidies and use public rights-of-way for their networks—they're already benefiting from taxpayer support. Municipal broadband just levels the playing field.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-do-we-know-tech-training-programs-will-actually-lead-to-jobs-not-just-leave-people-with-skills-they-cant-use">4. How do we know tech training programs will actually lead to jobs, not just leave people with skills they can't use?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Dave's policy includes job placement requirements, employer partnerships, and earn-while-you-learn apprenticeships that guarantee employment—not just training for training's sake.</p>
<p><strong>Job placement accountability:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Placement Rate Requirement:</strong> Training programs must achieve 75%+ job placement within 6 months at $55K+ wages or lose city funding—ensures programs accountable for outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employer Partnerships:</strong> All apprenticeships and 60% of bootcamp slots tied to specific employer commitments to hire graduates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apprenticeships:</strong> 150 apprentices annually EARN while learning ($18-30/hour)—they're already employed, just receiving training</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job Placement Incentives:</strong> $2,500 bonuses to employers hiring Louisville tech training graduates—creating hiring pipeline</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Peer city results prove this works:</strong>
- <strong>Nashville Software School:</strong> 78% job placement rate, $58K median starting salary
- <strong>Indianapolis tech apprenticeships:</strong> 87% completion rate, 94% employed within 3 months at median $64K
- <strong>Austin CodeUp:</strong> 82% placement rate for underrepresented groups</p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong> Louisville tech sector currently has 900+ open positions according to Indeed/LinkedIn—demand far exceeds supply. We're not training people for jobs that don't exist, we're filling desperate employer need for qualified local talent.</p>
<h3 id="5-what-prevents-the-innovation-district-from-just-becoming-another-way-for-wealthy-white-entrepreneurs-to-get-public-funding-while-black-and-brown-entrepreneurs-remain-excluded">5. What prevents the Innovation District from just becoming another way for wealthy white entrepreneurs to get public funding, while Black and brown entrepreneurs remain excluded?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Explicit equity requirements with teeth—not just aspirational goals.</p>
<p><strong>Hard accountability mechanisms:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>50% Funding Reservation:</strong> Half of startup capital ($1M annually) MUST go to entrepreneurs of color—not "should," MUST</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geographic Requirements:</strong> West Louisville location for flagship hub eliminates transportation/access barriers that exclude West Louisville entrepreneurs from East End incubator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Governance:</strong> West Louisville residents hold majority seats on Innovation District governance board with approval authority over investments—outside funders can't override community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outcome Tracking:</strong> If Year 2 evaluation shows less than 40% participation by entrepreneurs of color, Mayor must present corrective plan to Council—consequences for missing equity targets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Equity Requirements for Seed Grants:</strong> $25K-100K grants are equity-free—entrepreneurs keep 100% ownership (unlike typical VC that demands equity), ensuring Black/brown entrepreneurs aren't giving up ownership to access capital</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Comparison to typical startup funding:</strong>
- <strong>Status Quo:</strong> Less than 1% of VC funding nationally goes to Black founders despite Black people being 13% of population
- <strong>Dave's Program:</strong> 50% of funding reserved for entrepreneurs of color—complete flip of typical pattern</p>
<p><strong>We're designing this program explicitly to counter historic patterns of exclusion</strong>—not replicate them with public funds.</p>
<h3 id="6-city-government-has-a-terrible-track-record-with-technology-projects-that-run-over-budget-and-dont-workwhy-will-this-be-different">6. City government has a terrible track record with technology projects that run over budget and don't work—why will this be different?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Fair point—many government IT projects fail. Dave's approach differs in several critical ways:</p>
<p><strong>Different Approach:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Proven Platforms, Not Custom Development:</strong> We'll use proven civic tech platforms (like OpenGov, SeeClickFix) already working in 100+ cities—not building everything custom from scratch (where most projects fail)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agile Development:</strong> Iterative development with resident user testing, not "big bang" launches—launch with 20% of services, test, improve, expand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private Sector Expertise:</strong> Hire experienced Chief Innovation Officer and Chief Technology Officer from cities that have done this successfully—not relying on staff with no digital transformation experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear Metrics &amp; Accountability:</strong> Specific measurable goals (reduce wait time from 45 to &lt;5 minutes, 80% services online) with quarterly public reporting—if we're not hitting targets, change approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resident-Centered Design:</strong> Technology designed WITH residents through user testing, not FOR residents by people who've never used city services</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Risk Mitigation:</strong>
- Fixed-price contracts, not open-ended cost-plus
- Phased implementation with kill switches if not performing
- Independent evaluation at Year 2—if not working, we pivot</p>
<p><strong>Peer city proof it works:</strong>
- <strong>Indianapolis:</strong> Digital transformation reduced wait times from 35 minutes to 4 minutes on time and on budget
- <strong>Austin:</strong> Digital permitting on time, generating $45M in annual economic impact
- <strong>Boston:</strong> 311 app launched in 6 months under budget, now handles 500K+ requests annually</p>
<p><strong>It CAN be done right</strong>—but requires different approach than Louisville has taken historically. Dave's committed to modern best practices, not repeating past failures.</p>
<h3 id="7-wont-ai-and-automation-take-jobs-away-from-city-workers-why-invest-in-technology-that-eliminates-employment">7. Won't AI and automation take jobs away from city workers? Why invest in technology that eliminates employment?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Technology will eliminate TASKS (like manual data entry), not jobs—freeing city workers to do higher-value work serving residents better.</p>
<p><strong>Reality of city work:</strong>
- City employees currently spend 28% of time on manual tasks that should be automated—data re-entry, paper processing, repetitive questions
- That's not fulfilling work—it's drudgery keeping workers from actually helping residents
- Automation frees workers to solve complex resident problems, not just push paper</p>
<p><strong>No Layoffs Commitment:</strong>
Dave commits NO city workers will be laid off due to digital transformation. Instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Redeploy to High-Value Work:</strong> Workers freed from manual tasks redeploy to resident-facing services, complex problem-solving, community engagement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Natural Attrition:</strong> Any efficiency gains handled through natural attrition (retirements, departures)—not layoffs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upskilling:</strong> City invests in training current workers in digital skills so they can advance to higher-paying positions</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>
- <strong>Before AI Assistant:</strong> 311 operator spends 60% of time answering "When is trash pickup?" and "How do I pay parking ticket?"—repetitive questions taking time from complex resident issues
- <strong>After AI Assistant:</strong> AI handles routine questions 24/7, operator focuses on complex cases requiring human judgment, problem-solving—more fulfilling work, better resident service</p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong> Digital transformation improves worker satisfaction—Indianapolis reports 73% increase in employee satisfaction after digital transformation because workers doing meaningful work instead of soul-crushing data entry.</p>
<h3 id="8-how-will-you-ensure-city-data-is-secure-and-resident-privacy-is-protected-with-all-this-digitization-and-open-data">8. How will you ensure city data is secure and resident privacy is protected with all this digitization and open data?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Security and privacy are core to digital transformation—not afterthoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity Investment:</strong>
- $1M annually for security infrastructure, monitoring, incident response
- Comprehensive penetration testing before any system launches
- 24/7 security monitoring for threats
- Regular security training for all city employees
- Incident response plan for ransomware, breaches</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Protections:</strong>
- Open data releases only NON-SENSITIVE data—no personal information, no data that could identify individuals
- Data governance board reviews all data releases for privacy implications
- Compliance with all federal/state privacy laws (HIPAA for health data, FERPA for education data, etc.)
- Transparency about what data city collects and how it's used</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Open Data (OK) vs. Private Data (NOT Released):</strong>
- <strong>OK:</strong> Aggregated crime statistics by neighborhood
- <strong>NOT OK:</strong> Individual arrest records with names, addresses
- <strong>OK:</strong> Number of permits issued by type
- <strong>NOT OK:</strong> Permit applications with property owner information
- <strong>OK:</strong> 311 request response times by category
- <strong>NOT OK:</strong> 311 calls with caller identification</p>
<p><strong>Peer cities prove this can be done safely:</strong>
- <strong>NYC:</strong> 1,500+ open datasets, zero privacy breaches in 12 years
- <strong>Chicago:</strong> 1,000+ datasets, robust privacy framework preventing individual identification
- <strong>Seattle:</strong> Open data program with exemplary privacy protections, frequently cited as national model</p>
<p><strong>If anything, digitization IMPROVES security vs. current state:</strong>
- Paper records easily lost, stolen, no audit trail
- Disconnected databases more vulnerable than unified secure system
- Digital systems have encryption, access controls, monitoring that paper can't provide</p>
<h3 id="9-what-happens-to-people-who-dont-have-smartphones-or-computers-and-cant-use-digital-services-no-matter-how-good-they-are">9. What happens to people who don't have smartphones or computers and can't use digital services no matter how good they are?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Digital transformation EXPANDS options—it doesn't eliminate traditional in-person and phone service.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Channel Service:</strong>
- <strong>Digital:</strong> Mobile app, website for those who prefer it (available 24/7)
- <strong>Phone:</strong> Enhanced 311 service with AI handling routine questions, human staff for complex issues (faster than current 45-minute waits)
- <strong>In-Person:</strong> Metro offices remain open for residents who need face-to-face service
- <strong>Community Centers:</strong> Computer access and in-person assistance at libraries, community centers</p>
<p><strong>Digital Navigator Program:</strong>
30 community members trained to provide in-home tech support for seniors, immigrants, people with disabilities who need help accessing digital services—NO ONE left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Device Access:</strong>
20,000 free laptops/tablets distributed to low-income households over 4 years—if lack of device is barrier, we provide device.</p>
<p><strong>The goal is UNIVERSAL ACCESS through whatever channel works for each resident</strong>—not forcing everyone onto digital platform.</p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong> Digital services particularly benefit those who CAN'T easily access in-person service:
- Working parents who can't take time off to visit Metro offices during business hours
- People with disabilities who face transportation barriers
- Residents without cars in neighborhoods poorly served by transit
- People working multiple jobs with no time for 45-minute phone waits</p>
<p>Digital transformation makes government MORE accessible for most residents—while maintaining traditional channels for those who need them.</p>
<h3 id="10-this-seems-like-a-lot-of-money-38mcan-louisville-afford-this-when-we-have-so-many-other-pressing-needs">10. This seems like a lot of money ($38M)—can Louisville afford this when we have so many other pressing needs?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Louisville can't afford NOT to invest in technology—the cost of falling further behind is far higher than $38M.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Doing Nothing:</strong></p>
<p>Current technology deficit costs Louisville:
- <strong>$24M annually</strong> in wasted city productivity from manual processes
- <strong>$6.8M annually</strong> in wasted resident time (45-minute waits)
- <strong>$15-25M annually</strong> in delayed economic activity from slow permitting
- <strong>$43.8M annually</strong> in lost wages from tech brain drain (493 graduates leaving)
- <strong>Lost Tax Revenue:</strong> Estimated $8-12M annually from tech workers/businesses that leave for cities with better tech ecosystems</p>
<p><strong>Total cost of falling behind: $97-111M annually</strong>—2.5-3x what investment would cost.</p>
<p><strong>Return on Investment:</strong></p>
<p>$38M investment generates:
- <strong>$266-380M</strong> in annual economic impact (7-10x ROI)
- <strong>$7.5-11.5M</strong> in direct tax revenue
- <strong>$8M</strong> in city efficiency savings by Year 4
- <strong>$245M</strong> in new annual wages from tech job creation</p>
<p><strong>Net benefit: $228-342M annually</strong>—investment pays for itself many times over.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison to Other Investments:</strong></p>
<p>$38M is 3.7% of city budget—modest for transformational impact:
- Nashville invests $92M annually in tech/innovation (2.4% of their larger budget)
- Austin invests $140M annually (1.8% of their budget)
- Indianapolis invests $67M annually (3.1% of budget)</p>
<p><strong>Louisville's $38M investment is in line with peer cities</strong>—we're not over-investing, we're catching up to what successful cities already do.</p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong> Much of investment ($15M) comes from federal broadband grants, not city funds—we'd be leaving money on the table by not pursuing it.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> This is one of highest-ROI investments city can make. The question isn't "can we afford it?"—it's "can we afford to keep falling behind?"</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion-technology-for-the-people">CONCLUSION: TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE</h2>
<p>For too long, Louisville has approached technology as a luxury for those who can afford it—not essential infrastructure for everyone. Meanwhile, 91,000 households remain locked out of the digital economy, our tech graduates flee to cities investing in innovation, city government operates on technology from 2010, and we fall further behind peer cities building 21st-century economies.</p>
<p>Dave's Technology &amp; Innovation policy rejects this trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>It recognizes that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High-speed internet is as essential as water and electricity—no one should be excluded</li>
<li>Technology creates pathways to prosperity—IF we invest in training and ensure access</li>
<li>Innovation happens everywhere when given infrastructure and support—not just in wealthy neighborhoods</li>
<li>Modern government technology is a right, not a privilege—residents deserve efficient service</li>
<li>Louisville can compete in the innovation economy—IF we make strategic investments peer cities already made</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The choice is clear:</strong></p>
<p>Continue Louisville's current path—91,000 households without internet, losing 493 tech graduates annually to other cities, 45-minute waits for city services, falling further behind Nashville and Indianapolis in tech economy—and miss out on the fastest-growing, highest-wage sector.</p>
<p>Or invest $38M annually to close the digital divide, create 2,000+ tech jobs, modernize government, build innovation ecosystem, and transform Louisville into a competitive tech hub where innovation serves everyone.</p>
<p><strong>This is about more than apps and websites.</strong> It's about economic survival in a digital economy. It's about whether Louisville residents can access remote work opportunities, online education, telehealth, and government services. It's about whether our graduates stay or leave. It's about whether we fall further behind or catch up to peer cities.</p>
<p><strong>Dave's vision:</strong> A Louisville where every household has high-speed internet, every resident has pathways to tech careers paying $80,000+, innovation happens in West Louisville and every neighborhood, city government operates on cutting-edge technology serving residents efficiently, and our tech sector rivals Nashville and Indianapolis.</p>
<p><strong>A digital Louisville that works for everyone.</strong></p>
<p>That's democracy that works for everyone. That's the Louisville we'll build together.</p>
