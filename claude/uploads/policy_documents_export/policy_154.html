"I'd never done anything political before. But Dave's plan made so much sense - evidence-based, not political. I knocked my first door terrified. The voter thanked me for coming and said she'd been waiting for someone like Dave. I knocked 200 more doors that day. Now I'm a Team Captain training others."</p><h3>James's Story:</h3>
"As a retired teacher, I wanted to do something meaningful. Phone banking seemed safe (no door knocking!). I've made 5,000 calls. You know what I've learned? Louisville voters are smart. They get it when you explain the evidence. We're winning this because voters recognize real leadership when they see it."</p><h3>The JCPS Students:</h3>
"Our Political Science class did a project on Dave's campaign. We ended up forming our own volunteer team. Twenty of us knocked doors together on weekends. We registered 300 new voters. We're not old enough to vote yet, but we're building the Louisville we'll inherit."</p><p>---</p><h2>FINAL CHECKLIST: BUILDING TO 1,000 VOLUNTEERS</h2><h3>Months 1-3: Foundation</h3>
