<h2>Dave Biggers for Mayor - Volunteer Canvassing Guide</h2><p><strong>Version:</strong> Budget 3.1 (Updated October 12, 2025)  
<strong>Website:</strong> rundaverun.org</p><p>---</p><h2>BEFORE YOU START</h2><p><strong>Your Mission:</strong> Have friendly conversations with Louisville voters about Dave's budget plan.</p><p><strong>You're NOT:</strong> A policy expert, a debate champion, or a salesperson  
<strong>You ARE:</strong> A neighbor sharing good information about a better approach</p><p><strong>Remember:</strong>
<ul><li>Be friendly and respectful</li>
<li>Listen more than you talk</li>
<li>It's okay to say "I don't know - let me get you that information"</li>
<li>Your enthusiasm matters more than memorizing every detail</li></p><p>---</p><h2>THE 30-SECOND PITCH</h2><p>Use this when someone answers the door:</p><p>&gt; <strong>"Hi! I'm [NAME], a volunteer with Dave Biggers' campaign for mayor. Have you got 30 seconds?"</strong>
&gt;
&gt; <strong>[If yes]</strong>
&gt;
&gt; <strong>"Dave has a plan to make Louisville safer using the same budget the current mayor already approved - $1.2 billion, no tax increase. The difference? Instead of just responding to crime after it happens, we'd put police officers in 46 mini substations across every neighborhood AND open 18 community wellness centers for mental health and addiction. It's working in 50 other cities with big crime reductions."</strong>
&gt;
&gt; <strong>"Can Dave count on your support on Election Day?"</strong></p><p><strong>That's it. Simple. Friendly. Clear.</strong></p><p>---</p><h2>IF THEY WANT MORE INFORMATION</h2><h3>The 2-Minute Version:</h3><p>&gt; <strong>"Great question. Here's the plan:</strong>
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Same Budget - $1.2 billion, exactly what the current spending. Zero tax increase.</strong>
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Three Big Changes:</strong>
&gt;
&gt; <strong>1. Mini Police Substations</strong> - 46 neighborhood police offices across Louisville. Officers on foot in YOUR neighborhood instead of just driving by in patrol cars. They'll know residents by name, prevent crime before it happens. This works in Chicago, New York, LA - 50+ cities. Average 25% crime reduction.
&gt;
&gt; <strong>2. Community Wellness Centers</strong> - 18 health centers in underserved areas. Primary care, mental health, addiction treatment - all in one place. Prevents crises before they become 911 calls. Saves money, saves lives.
&gt;
&gt; <strong>3. Youth Programs</strong> - After-school programs, summer jobs for 3,000 teens, mentoring. Kids in programs during peak crime hours (3-7pm) are 35% less likely to commit crimes.
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Where's the money from?</strong> Cutting bureaucracy waste and jail costs (through bail reform), redirecting it to prevention. Same total budget, smarter priorities.
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Has it worked?</strong> Yes - 50+ cities prove it. Boston cut youth homicides by 63%. Newark reduced shootings by 35%. This is proven, not experimental.
&gt;
&gt; <strong>Can Dave count on your vote?"</strong></p><p>---</p><h2>TOP 10 QUESTIONS &amp; YOUR ANSWERS</h2><h3>1. "Where does the money come from?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Great question. Total budget is $1.2 billion - exactly the same as the current approved budget. Zero tax increase. We're just spending it differently - cutting administrative waste and reducing jail costs through smarter bail reform, then investing that money in prevention programs. Same total, better priorities."</p><h3>2. "Isn't this defunding the police?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "No, actually police get the exact same budget - $245.9 million, same as the current plan. We're not cutting a penny. The difference is HOW we deploy officers. Instead of distant precincts and patrol cars, we're putting them on foot in 46 neighborhood substations. Same money, smarter deployment. Preventing crime instead of just responding to it."</p><h3>3. "Will my taxes go up?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Absolutely not. Zero tax increase. This budget is $1.2 billion - the exact same total as the current approved 2025-2026 budget. We're reallocating within the same total, not adding new spending."</p><h3>4. "What's a mini substation?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Think of it like a small neighborhood police office - maybe 5,000 square feet - where officers work from instead of a distant precinct. Officers walk the neighborhood, attend community meetings, know residents by name. There'll be one in every zip code - 46 total across Louisville. They're open 24/7 and become part of the community. It's proven to reduce crime by 20-30% on average."</p><h3>5. "Has this worked anywhere else?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Yes! Over 50 major American cities use this model. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, Baltimore - they're all doing community policing with neighborhood substations. Boston reduced youth homicides by 63%. Newark reduced shootings by 35%. Los Angeles cut violent crime 18% in program areas. This isn't experimental - it's proven."</p><h3>6. "What about violent crime?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Full police response stays the same - officers still respond to violent crime, we still investigate and prosecute. But we're also PREVENTING crime before it happens through community presence and youth programs. Cities using this approach see 35% average reduction in violent crime over 4 years. Prevention works better than just reaction."</p><h3>7. "What are wellness centers?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Healthcare hubs in underserved neighborhoods. Each one has nurses, mental health counselors, addiction treatment, social workers - all in one place. Right now, 40% of police calls involve mental health or substance abuse. Wellness centers handle these better than sending armed police officers. They also prevent problems before they become crises. Costs $2.5 million per center, but saves money in reduced ER visits and fewer repeat 911 calls."</p><h3>8. "What happens to current city employees?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "No layoffs. Zero. Every employee keeps their job. Some get reassigned to new positions in wellness centers, youth programs, or community roles - often better, more meaningful work. We're creating over 400 new positions. All union contracts honored. Training provided for new roles."</p><h3>9. "When will we see results?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Year 1 you'll see 12 substations open, 6 wellness centers operating, expanded youth programs. Early crime data trends should show improvement. By Year 4, all 46 substations and 18 wellness centers will be running, and we're targeting 35% crime reduction. But major impact starts in Year 1, not Year 4."</p><h3>10. "Why should I trust this?"</h3><p><strong>YOU:</strong> "Because it's not based on promises - it's based on evidence from 50+ cities that are doing this right now and seeing real results. The full detailed budget is public at rundaverun.org - 831 lines, every dollar accounted for. It's the most transparent campaign budget Louisville has ever seen. You can verify everything."</p><p>---</p><h2>HANDLING SPECIFIC CONCERNS</h2><h3>If they're worried about CRIME:</h3>
<strong>"That's exactly why Dave's running. Current approach isn't working. We need prevention - officers in neighborhoods, wellness centers, youth programs. 50+ cities prove it reduces crime by 20-35%. Same police budget, just deployed smarter to prevent crime before it happens."</strong></p><h3>If they're worried about TAXES:</h3>
<strong>"Zero tax increase. I promise. Same total as the current budget: $1.2 billion. It's all reallocation within the existing budget. Not a penny more in taxes."</strong></p><h3>If they're worried about POLICE SAFETY:</h3>
<strong>"This actually makes officers safer. When police know the community and community knows police, there's trust. Officers aren't strangers showing up to crises - they're familiar faces who've been walking the neighborhood. Research shows community policing reduces officer injuries because there's less conflict."</strong></p><h3>If they're pro-POLICE:</h3>
<strong>"Then you'll love this plan. Police get the same $245.9 million as the current budget, but better working conditions. Officers work from neighborhood substations instead of distant precincts, they get industry-leading training ($15M/year), and they finally get to do PREVENTION instead of just reacting to crimes. Ask any cop - they'd rather prevent crimes than respond to them."</strong></p><h3>If they're worried about THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD:</h3>
<strong>"Every zip code gets a mini substation. From the West End to the East End, Clifton to Shively, Portland to Highlands - every neighborhood. You'll have officers on foot who actually know your streets. That's the promise."</strong></p><h3>If they're concerned about the current mayor:</h3>
<strong>"This isn't about attacking anyone. It's about having different priorities. the current approach has had years and hasn't reduced crime. Dave's offering a proven alternative from 50+ cities. Same cost, better results. That's the choice voters get to make."</strong></p><p>---</p><h2>DIFFICULT SITUATIONS</h2><h3>If someone is HOSTILE or ANGRY:</h3>
<strong>"I hear you, and I respect your opinion. If you're interested in learning more, all the details are at rundaverun.org. Have a good day!"</strong></p><p><strong>DON'T:</strong> Argue, get defensive, or try to "win"  
<strong>DO:</strong> Stay calm, respectful, and move on</p><h3>If someone says "I don't vote" or "I hate all politicians":</h3>
<strong>"I get that. A lot of people feel that way. But Dave's budget is different - it's fully public, every line item, based on what actually works in other cities, not political promises. Sometimes one person really is different. At least check out rundaverun.org and decide for yourself. No pressure."</strong></p><h3>If someone wants information you DON'T HAVE:</h3>
<strong>"That's a really good question, and I don't want to give you wrong information. Can I get your email or phone number? I'll have someone from the campaign get you the accurate answer within 24 hours."</strong></p><p><strong>Write down:</strong> Their name, contact info, and the specific question  
<strong>Follow up:</strong> Email info@rundaverun.org with the question immediately after your canvassing shift</p><h3>If someone wants to DEBATE DETAILS:</h3>
<strong>"You clearly know a lot about policy! I'm just a volunteer, but I'd love to connect you with someone from the campaign who can have that detailed conversation with you. Can I get your email?"</strong></p><p><strong>DON'T:</strong> Pretend to be an expert if you're not  
<strong>DO:</strong> Get them connected to campaign staff who can answer thoroughly</p><h3>If someone is UNDECIDED and thoughtful:</h3>
<strong>"That's totally fair. This is a big decision. Can I leave you this information to review? The full budget is at rundaverun.org if you want to dive deep into the numbers. We're also having a community meeting on [DATE] where Dave will be answering questions if you want to meet him and ask directly."</strong></p><p>---</p><h2>WHAT TO BRING</h2><p><strong>Required:</strong>

<strong>THEM:</strong> "Sure."

[Collect info, thank them, move to next door]</p><h3>CONVERSATION 2: Skeptical Voter</h3>
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Hi! I'm James, with Dave Biggers for mayor. Have you heard about his budget plan?"  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "Nah, I don't really pay attention to politics. They're all the same."  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "I get it, but this is different. Dave published his entire budget online - every dollar, every line item. Based on what actually works in other cities, not political promises. At least worth a look at rundaverun.org to decide for yourself."  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "Maybe. What's the main thing?"  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Police in your neighborhood preventing crime instead of just responding to it after it happens. Same budget total, smarter approach. 50 cities prove it works."  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "Interesting. I'll check it out."  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Great! Here's a one-pager with the basics. Have a good day!"</p><h3>CONVERSATION 3: Concerned Parent</h3>
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Hi! I'm Sarah, volunteering with Dave Biggers for mayor. Do you have a minute?"  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "I guess. What's this about?"  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Dave's running on a plan to make Louisville safer using the same budget we already have - no tax increase. Big focus on youth programs - after-school programs during peak crime hours, 3,000 summer jobs for teens. Kids in these programs are 35% less likely to get in trouble. You have kids?"  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "Yeah, two teenagers."  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Then you know those 3-7pm hours after school are when kids can get in trouble if they're not supervised. Dave's plan puts them in programs with mentors, homework help, sports. Keeps them safe and on track."  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "That actually sounds really good. Does it cost more?"  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Nope! Same total budget - $1.2 billion, exactly what we're already spending. Just better priorities. Can Dave count on your vote?"  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "Probably, yeah. Let me read more about it."  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Perfect! Here's a one-pager, and everything's at rundaverun.org. Can I get your email for updates?"</p><h3>CONVERSATION 4: Pro-Police Voter</h3>
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Hi! I'm David with Dave Biggers for mayor. Quick question: What do you think about public safety in Louisville?"  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "I think we need to support our police, not cut their budgets like some people want."  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "I completely agree. That's why Dave's keeping the police budget at $245.9 million - exact same as the current plan. Zero cuts. But here's the difference: Instead of working from distant precincts, officers would work from 46 mini substations across every neighborhood. On foot, in communities. Officers know residents, residents know officers. That's how you build trust and prevent crime."  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "So the police budget stays the same?"  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Exactly the same. We're just deploying officers smarter - in neighborhoods, not just in patrol cars. Police get better training too - $15 million per year. This actually makes their jobs better AND safer because they have community support."  
<strong>THEM:</strong> "Okay, I like that. I was worried he was one of those defund people."  
<strong>YOU:</strong> "Nope. Dave fully funds police at the same level. Just uses it smarter. Can he count on your support?"</p><p>---</p><h2>WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE</h2><p><strong>You're doing GREAT if:</strong>
