[Contact Information]</p><p>---</p><h2>PART 6: ENDORSEMENT FAQ</h2><h3>Questions Endorsers Commonly Ask:</h3><p><strong>Q: Why should I endorse you vs. staying neutral?</strong>
A: Louisville needs change, and your voice matters in making that happen. Staying neutral maintains the status quo. Your endorsement signals to voters that this isn't just another campaign - it's a serious, evidence-based movement for transformation.</p><p><strong>Q: What will you expect from me after I endorse?</strong>
A: Nothing beyond the endorsement itself, unless you'd like to be more involved. We welcome endorsers who want to host events, speak on our behalf, or help recruit volunteers, but there's no requirement. Your name and statement of support are valuable in themselves.</p><p><strong>Q: How will you announce my endorsement?</strong>
A: We'll coordinate timing with you. Typically: a press release, social media posts, and inclusion on our website. For major endorsements, we may suggest a joint event or press conference.</p><p><strong>Q: What if I disagree with you on some issues?</strong>
A: You don't need to agree on everything to endorse. Focus on what brought you to support: evidence-based governance, fiscal responsibility, community partnership, or whatever resonates. We welcome diverse supporters.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I endorse as an individual vs. my organization?</strong>
A: Absolutely. We're grateful for both individual and organizational endorsements. You can clarify that you're endorsing in your personal capacity if needed.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you handle criticism or attacks?</strong>
A: With facts and evidence. We don't engage in personal attacks or mudslinging. We respond to criticisms with data, research, and our detailed plans. We keep it professional and focused on what works for Louisville.</p><p><strong>Q: Are you electable?</strong>
A: Yes. We're building a broad coalition - progressives who want evidence-based governance, moderates who want fiscal responsibility, and anyone tired of politics as usual. Our grassroots support is growing, our fundraising is solid, and our message resonates across demographics.</p><p><strong>Q: Will this hurt my reputation if you lose?</strong>
A: Endorsing the candidate who offers the most detailed, evidence-based plan for Louisville will never hurt your reputation. Win or lose, you'll be on record supporting serious governance over political rhetoric.</p><p><strong>Q: How can I help beyond the endorsement?</strong>
A: We'd welcome your involvement in whatever capacity works for you:
<li>Host a house party or event</li>
<li>Recruit volunteers from your network</li>
<li>Speak at community forums</li>
<li>Share on social media</li>
<li>Make calls to friends and colleagues</li>
<li>Contribute financially if you're able</li></p><p><strong>Q: What's your position on [specific issue]?</strong>
