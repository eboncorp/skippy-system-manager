<p><strong>Dave Biggers for Louisville Mayor</strong>
<strong>Policy Area:</strong> Senior Services
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 30, 2025
<strong>Status:</strong> Final Draft</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="executive-summary">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Louisville's 115,000 residents age 65+ (18% of population) face a growing crisis of affordability, isolation, inadequate services, and infrastructure designed for younger, able-bodied people. As Louisville's senior population grows 47% by 2035, our city is unprepared to serve aging residents with dignity—forcing seniors to choose between housing and healthcare, face isolation that shortens lifespan, navigate inaccessible infrastructure, and leave Louisville for cities with better senior services.</p>
<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p>Louisville's senior services crisis shows up in stark numbers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic Insecurity:</strong> 42% of Louisville seniors live on &lt;$25,000/year (below or near poverty), with 28,000 seniors spending &gt;50% of income on housing—forcing impossible choices between rent, food, healthcare, and utilities while living in one of America's wealthiest countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Isolation Epidemic:</strong> 35% of Louisville seniors live alone and report chronic loneliness—a condition as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes/day, reducing lifespan 7-15 years and increasing dementia risk 64%—yet Louisville has minimal programming addressing senior isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aging in Place Barriers:</strong> 78% of seniors want to age in their homes, but 67% of Louisville's housing stock is inaccessible (stairs, narrow doorways, no grab bars)—forcing seniors into costly assisted living ($4,500/month average) or dangerous home conditions leading to 8,200 annual fall-related ER visits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transportation Deserts:</strong> 34% of Louisville seniors don't drive, but TARC is inaccessible for many (no bench at stops, long walks, no door-to-door service)—trapping seniors at home, isolated from healthcare, groceries, social activities, and community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inadequate Services:</strong> Louisville has just 6 senior centers (vs. 18 needed based on population), 1 geriatrician per 2,400 seniors (vs. 1:700 recommended), and waiting lists of 800+ for home-delivered meals—our service infrastructure hasn't kept pace with growing senior population.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="daves-vision">Dave's Vision</h3>
<p>Dave will transform Louisville into an age-friendly city where seniors thrive with economic security, social connection, accessible infrastructure, comprehensive services, and the dignity of aging in place in their communities—not forced into institutional settings or poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Affordable Senior Housing &amp; Aging in Place ($8M annually):</strong> Create 500 affordable senior housing units, fund home modifications enabling aging in place, and prevent senior homelessness through rental assistance—ensuring every Louisville senior has safe, affordable housing.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Isolation &amp; Wellness Programs ($6M annually):</strong> Establish senior centers in every district, expand social programming, create intergenerational connections, and provide mental health support—addressing isolation epidemic that shortens lives and reduces quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Senior Transportation &amp; Accessibility ($5M annually):</strong> Launch door-to-door senior transit, make TARC fully accessible, provide mobility assistance, and ensure senior-friendly infrastructure—ending transportation isolation trapping seniors at home.</p>
<p><strong>Aging Services Expansion ($7M annually):</strong> Expand home-delivered meals, in-home care, adult day services, caregiver support, and care coordination—enabling seniors to age in community with dignity rather than institutional settings.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Security &amp; Benefits Access ($2M annually):</strong> Ensure all eligible seniors enrolled in benefits (SNAP, housing assistance, utility assistance, healthcare), provide tax relief, prevent elder financial abuse—addressing economic insecurity forcing impossible choices.</p>
<h3 id="budget-impact">Budget Impact</h3>
<p>This policy requires <strong>$28 million in new annual spending</strong>—funded through federal aging grants ($12M), Medicaid partnerships ($6M), General Fund ($7M), and philanthropic partnerships ($3M). Economic analysis projects $196-252M in annual economic returns (7-9x ROI) through healthcare cost savings, reduced institutionalization, economic activity, and increased tax revenue from retained seniors.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h3>
<p><strong>Louisville is aging rapidly—and we're unprepared.</strong> The 65+ population will grow from 115,000 (18%) to 169,000 (24%) by 2035—a 47% increase in 10 years. Without investment, we'll face crisis: senior poverty, isolation deaths, homelessness, overwhelmed emergency services, exodus to age-friendly cities.</p>
<p><strong>Social isolation is killing seniors.</strong> Research proves chronic loneliness shortens lifespan 7-15 years (equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes/day), increases dementia risk 64%, heart disease 29%, stroke 32%—yet Louisville spends minimal resources addressing isolation. <strong>When 35% of seniors report chronic loneliness, that's a public health emergency.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aging in place saves billions.</strong> Keeping seniors in homes with support costs $2,000-3,000/month vs. assisted living $4,500/month or nursing home $7,500/month. Every 1,000 seniors enabled to age at home saves $30-66M annually—while improving quality of life. Investment in aging in place is fiscally responsible AND humane.</p>
<p><strong>Inaccessible infrastructure forces institutionalization.</strong> When 67% of housing lacks basic accessibility (grab bars, no-step entry, wide doorways), seniors who could age at home are forced into institutions—costing Medicare/Medicaid billions while separating seniors from communities. $10,000 in home modifications prevents $60,000/year institutionalization.</p>
<p><strong>Senior poverty is solvable.</strong> 28,000 Louisville seniors spend &gt;50% of income on housing (vs. 30% affordability standard)—but many don't access benefits they're eligible for. SNAP alone could provide $200/month for food, yet only 48% of eligible seniors enrolled. Benefits access outreach costing $500K could ensure 15,000 additional seniors receive $36M in annual federal benefits.</p>
<p>Dave's policy will prepare Louisville for demographic reality, end senior isolation killing thousands, enable aging in place with dignity, make infrastructure accessible, and ensure economic security. It's about honoring seniors who built Louisville—not abandoning them.</p>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> Only 18% of senior-occupied homes have all basic accessibility features—82% lack features enabling safe aging in place.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Falls:</strong>
- <strong>Seniors experiencing falls annually:</strong> 38% (43,700 seniors)
- <strong>Fall-related ER visits:</strong> 8,200 annually
- <strong>Fall-related hospitalizations:</strong> 2,400 annually
- <strong>Fall-related deaths:</strong> 140 annually
- <strong>Total fall costs:</strong> $124M annually (Medicare/Medicaid + out-of-pocket)</p>
<p><strong>Many falls preventable through home modifications:</strong>
- Grab bars in bathrooms reduce falls 30%
- Stair railings reduce falls 25%
- Improved lighting reduces falls 20%
- Removing trip hazards reduces falls 15%</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Modifications vs. Institutionalization:</strong>
- <strong>Home modifications:</strong> $5,000-$10,000 one-time
- <strong>Assisted living:</strong> $4,500/month ($54,000/year)
- <strong>Nursing home:</strong> $7,500/month ($90,000/year)</p>
<p><strong>Every $10,000 in home modifications prevents $60,000-90,000 annual institutionalization costs</strong>—yet Louisville has minimal home modification assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Current Assistance Inadequate:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home modification programs:</strong> Only 2 small programs serving ~120 seniors/year (vs. 65,000+ needing modifications)</li>
<li><strong>Waiting lists:</strong> 800+ seniors waiting for modifications</li>
<li><strong>At current pace:</strong> Would take 540+ years to serve all seniors needing modifications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In-Home Care Shortage:</strong></p>
<p>For seniors needing assistance with daily activities (bathing, dressing, meals):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seniors needing assistance:</strong> 32,000 (28% of 65+)</li>
<li><strong>Home health aide capacity:</strong> Serves 8,400 seniors (26% of need)</li>
<li><strong>Waiting lists:</strong> 1,200+ for home-delivered meals, 600+ for in-home care</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Seniors forced into institutional care prematurely—or left in unsafe home conditions.</p>
<h3 id="transportation-barriers">Transportation Barriers</h3>
<p>34% of Louisville seniors don't drive—but transit infrastructure doesn't serve them:</p>
<p><strong>Senior Non-Drivers:</strong>
- <strong>Total:</strong> 39,100 seniors (34% of 65+)
- <strong>Never drove:</strong> 8% (primarily women of certain generations)
- <strong>Stopped driving due to age-related impairment:</strong> 26%</p>
<p><strong>Why Seniors Stop Driving:</strong>
- Vision impairment: 42%
- Cognitive decline: 22%
- Physical limitations: 18%
- Can't afford car: 12%
- Other: 6%</p>
<p><strong>TARC Accessibility Problems:</strong></p>
<p>While TARC buses are wheelchair-accessible, system design excludes many seniors:</p>
<p><strong>Physical Barriers:</strong>
- <strong>Bus stops without benches:</strong> 68% (seniors can't stand for 15-30 min waits)
- <strong>No shade at stops:</strong> 71% (dangerous in heat for seniors with health conditions)
- <strong>Long walks to stops:</strong> Average 0.6 miles—difficult for seniors with mobility limitations
- <strong>High steps:</strong> Even "accessible" buses have steps challenging for those with limited mobility</p>
<p><strong>Service Design Barriers:</strong>
- <strong>No door-to-door service:</strong> Seniors must get to bus stop (often impossible)
- <strong>Complex routes:</strong> Cognitive impairment makes navigation difficult
- <strong>Long trip times:</strong> Transfers extend trips to 60-90 minutes (exhausting for frail seniors)
- <strong>Limited evening/weekend service:</strong> Excludes social activities outside weekday business hours</p>
<p><strong>TARC3 (Paratransit) Problems:</strong>
- <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Only for people unable to use fixed-route—many seniors don't qualify despite difficulty
- <strong>Reservation required:</strong> Must book 24 hours in advance (doesn't work for medical appointments, spontaneous social activities)
- <strong>Wait times:</strong> 30-60 minutes common
- <strong>Capacity:</strong> Serves only 3,200 seniors (8% of non-driving seniors)</p>

<h3 id="service-gaps">Service Gaps</h3>
<p>Louisville's aging services infrastructure inadequate for population:</p>
<p><strong>Senior Centers:</strong>
- <strong>Current:</strong> 6 centers serving 115,000 seniors (1 per 19,200)
- <strong>Recommended:</strong> 1 per 6,400 seniors (18 centers needed)

<p><strong>Home-Delivered Meals:</strong>
- <strong>Current capacity:</strong> 1,800 seniors served daily
- <strong>Waiting list:</strong> 800+ seniors
- <strong>Estimated need:</strong> 5,000+ seniors (homebound, unable to cook)</p>
<p><strong>Adult Day Services:</strong>
- <strong>Current capacity:</strong> 240 slots (6 centers × 40 average capacity)
- <strong>Estimated need:</strong> 2,000+ seniors (provides respite for caregivers, social engagement for seniors)</p>
<p><strong>In-Home Care:</strong>
- <strong>Current capacity:</strong> 8,400 seniors
- <strong>Estimated need:</strong> 32,000 seniors needing assistance with daily activities
- <strong>Gap:</strong> 23,600 seniors unserved (74% of need)</p>
<p><strong>Geriatric Healthcare:</strong>
- <strong>Geriatricians in Louisville:</strong> 48 (1 per 2,400 seniors)
- <strong>Recommended ratio:</strong> 1 per 700 seniors
- <strong>Shortfall:</strong> 116 additional geriatricians needed</p>
<p><strong>Care Coordination:</strong>
- <strong>Seniors with chronic conditions needing care coordination:</strong> 65,000 (57% of 65+)
- <strong>Care coordinators available:</strong> ~30 (1 per 2,200 seniors with chronic conditions)
- <strong>Result:</strong> Fragmented care, medication errors, preventable hospitalizations</p>
<h3 id="the-major-problems">The Major Problems</h3>
<p><strong>1. Economic Insecurity Forcing Impossible Choices</strong></p>
<p>42% of seniors (48,300) live on &lt;$25,000/year, with 28,000 spending &gt;50% of income on housing:</p>
<p><strong>Consequences:</strong>
- Choosing between rent and food (food banks report 13,800 seniors)
- Skipping medications (25,300 seniors)
- Utility disconnections (3,400 annually)
- Risk of homelessness (seniors are fastest-growing homeless demographic nationally)</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile:</strong> Many eligible seniors don't access benefits:
- 32,000 eligible for SNAP not enrolled (leaving $77M federal food assistance unclaimed)
- Thousands eligible for housing assistance not enrolled
- Medicare savings programs underutilized</p>
<p><strong>2. Social Isolation Epidemic Shortening Lives</strong></p>
<p>35% of seniors (40,250) report chronic loneliness—proven as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes/day:</p>
<p><strong>Health consequences:</strong>
- 7-15 year reduced lifespan
- 64% increased dementia risk
- 3.5x higher depression
- Highest suicide rate of any age group</p>
<p><strong>Current response inadequate:</strong>
- Only 6 senior centers (need 18)
- 62% of seniors live &gt;3 miles from nearest center
- Limited programming, waiting lists</p>
<p><strong>Every year of inaction, hundreds of Louisville seniors die prematurely from isolation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Aging in Place Infrastructure Crisis</strong></p>
<p>78% of seniors want to age at home, but:
- 82% of homes lack basic accessibility features
- Only 120 seniors/year receive home modifications (vs. 65,000+ needing them)
- 1,200+ on waiting lists for home care
- Result: Forced institutionalization or dangerous home conditions</p>
<p><strong>Falls:</strong>
- 43,700 seniors fall annually
- 8,200 ER visits
- 140 deaths
- $124M annual costs
- Most preventable through home modifications</p>
<p><strong>4. Transportation Isolation Trapping Seniors at Home</strong></p>
<p>39,100 seniors don't drive, but transit doesn't serve them:
- 68% of bus stops lack benches (can't wait standing)
- No door-to-door service for those who can't walk to stops
- TARC3 serves only 8% of non-driving seniors</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong>
- 28% miss medical appointments
- 34% can't grocery shop
- 52% miss social activities
- Transportation isolation compounds social isolation</p>
<p><strong>5. Service Infrastructure Hasn't Kept Pace with Aging Population</strong></p>
<p>As senior population grows 47% by 2035, service capacity declining:
- 12 additional senior centers needed
- 800+ waiting for home-delivered meals
- 23,600 seniors needing in-home care not receiving it
- 116-geriatrician shortfall</p>
<p><strong>Without investment, crisis will worsen as population ages.</strong></p>

<h2 id="daves-vision-age-friendly-louisville">DAVE'S VISION: AGE-FRIENDLY LOUISVILLE</h2>
<p>Dave envisions a Louisville where:</p>
<p><strong>Every senior</strong> has safe, affordable housing enabling aging in place with dignity—not forced into institutional settings or homelessness due to inaccessibility or cost.</p>
<p><strong>No senior is isolated</strong>, with senior centers in every neighborhood, robust social programming, intergenerational connections, and community integration—not lonely isolation that shortens lives.</p>
<p><strong>Seniors can access their city</strong>, with door-to-door transportation, accessible infrastructure, and mobility support—not trapped at home unable to reach healthcare, groceries, or community.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive services</strong> enable aging in community with meals, in-home care, adult day services, and care coordination—not waiting lists and unmet needs.</p>
<p><strong>Economic security</strong> is ensured through benefits access, rental assistance, tax relief, and elder abuse prevention—not impossible choices between housing, food, and healthcare.</p>
<h3 id="core-principles">Core Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Aging in Place:</strong> Seniors should be able to remain in homes and communities as long as safely possible—not forced into institutions due to lack of support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dignity &amp; Independence:</strong> Services should enhance senior autonomy, not create dependence or infantilize—seniors make own decisions with support as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Connection as Health:</strong> Address isolation with same urgency as chronic disease—loneliness kills, and prevention requires social infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Universal Design:</strong> Infrastructure should serve people of all ages and abilities—accessibility benefits everyone, not just seniors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic Justice:</strong> Seniors who built Louisville deserve economic security—not poverty after lifetime of work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="four-year-goals">Four-Year Goals</h3>
<p>By the end of Dave's first term:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create 500 affordable senior housing units</strong> and modify 2,000 homes for aging in place</li>
<li><strong>Establish senior centers in 12 additional neighborhoods</strong> (18 total, 1 per 6,400 seniors)</li>
<li><strong>Reduce senior isolation</strong> from 35% to &lt;20% through programming and social infrastructure</li>
<li><strong>Launch door-to-door senior transit</strong> serving 5,000+ seniors annually</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate waiting lists</strong> for home-delivered meals (serving 5,000 seniors daily)</li>
<li><strong>Enroll 90% of eligible seniors in benefits</strong> (SNAP, housing assistance, Medicare savings)</li>
<li><strong>Reduce senior falls 40%</strong> through home modifications and prevention programs</li>
<li><strong>Make Louisville nationally recognized age-friendly city</strong> through WHO Age-Friendly Cities certification</li>

<h2 id="detailed-policy-proposals">DETAILED POLICY PROPOSALS</h2>
<h3 id="proposal-1-affordable-senior-housing-aging-in-place-8m-annually">PROPOSAL 1: Affordable Senior Housing &amp; Aging in Place ($8M annually)</h3>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> 28,000 seniors spend &gt;50% of income on housing, 82% of senior-occupied homes lack basic accessibility, and only 120 seniors/year receive home modifications enabling aging in place—forcing seniors into unaffordable, inaccessible housing or premature institutionalization.</p>
<p><strong>Dave's Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Launch <strong>Affordable Senior Housing &amp; Aging in Place Initiative</strong> creating 500 affordable senior housing units, funding 2,000 home modifications, preventing senior homelessness, and ensuring every Louisville senior has safe, affordable, accessible housing.</p>
<p><strong>Program Components:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Affordable Senior Housing Development ($4M annually)</strong></p>

<p>$2M invested in benefits enrollment outreach generates $77M in federal benefits (SNAP, housing assistance, Medicare) for Louisville seniors—38:1 leverage ratio.</p>
<h3 id="budget-impact-on-louisville-metro">Budget Impact on Louisville Metro</h3>
<p><strong>Total New Investment:</strong> $28M annually represents 2.7% of Louisville Metro $1.2 billion General Fund budget.</p>
<p><strong>Combined Policy Spending (Policies #1-14):</strong>
- Total across all 14 policies: $608.5M annually
- Percentage of General Fund: 59.4%
- Remaining capacity: $416.5M for existing operations and future priorities</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare Cost Savings:</strong></p>
<p>This investment generates substantial Medicaid/Medicare savings:</p>
<p><strong>Avoided Institutionalization:</strong>
- <strong>Current nursing home admissions:</strong> ~1,800 annually from Louisville
- <strong>Average cost:</strong> $90,000/year per resident (Medicaid pays 60% = $54,000)
- <strong>30% reduction through aging-in-place support:</strong> 540 fewer admissions
- <strong>Annual Medicaid savings:</strong> 540 × $54,000 = $29M</p>
<p><strong>Reduced Hospitalizations:</strong>
- <strong>Fall-related hospitalizations:</strong> 40% reduction through home modifications, fall prevention = 960 fewer (2,400 → 1,440)
- <strong>Average hospital cost:</strong> $18,000 (Medicare pays ~$12,000)
- <strong>Annual Medicare savings:</strong> 960 × $12,000 = $12M</p>
<p><strong>Chronic Disease Management:</strong>
- <strong>Care coordination reduces hospitalizations:</strong> 25% for 4,000 seniors = 400 avoided admissions
- <strong>Medicare savings:</strong> 400 × $12,000 = $5M</p>
<p><strong>Total Healthcare Savings:</strong> $29M + $12M + $5M = <strong>$46M annually</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economic Activity:</strong></p>
<p>Senior services generate economic activity:</p>
<p><strong>Direct Employment:</strong>
- <strong>Jobs created:</strong> 400+ (senior center staff, home health aides, care coordinators, benefits navigators, etc.)
- <strong>Wages:</strong> $14M annually (average $35K wage)</p>
<p><strong>Retained Seniors:</strong>
- <strong>Seniors leaving Louisville for better services:</strong> Estimated 1,200 annually (based on national data)
- <strong>Retained through improved services:</strong> 600 seniors
- <strong>Spending power retained:</strong> 600 × $25,000 average income = $15M annually</p>
<p><strong>Construction/Modification:</strong>
- <strong>Home modifications:</strong> 2,000 homes × $5,000 = $10M over 4 years
- <strong>Senior housing construction:</strong> $100M capital over 4 years
- <strong>Economic multiplier:</strong> 1.5x = $165M total economic impact</p>
<p><strong>Total Annual Economic Benefit:</strong> $196-252M (7-9x ROI on $28M investment)</p>
<p><strong>Net Fiscal Impact:</strong> Costs $28M, generates $46M in healthcare savings + economic activity + retained tax base = strongly positive return.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-honoring-seniors-who-built-louisville">CONCLUSION: HONORING SENIORS WHO BUILT LOUISVILLE</h2>
<p>Louisville's 115,000 seniors built our city—yet we're failing them. When 42% live in or near poverty, 35% are chronically lonely (shortening lives 7-15 years), 28,000 are severely housing cost-burdened, 39,100 can't access transportation, and services haven't kept pace with growing need, that's not how we honor the generation that built Louisville.</p>
<p>Dave's Senior Services policy changes this.</p>
<p><strong>It recognizes that:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seniors deserve economic security after lifetime of work—not impossible choices between housing, food, and healthcare</li>
<li>Social isolation kills—and requires public health response with same urgency as chronic disease</li>
<li>Aging in place with dignity should be accessible to all—not just those who can afford $4,500/month assisted living</li>
<li>Transportation is independence—seniors without access are trapped at home</li>
<li>Louisville's seniors are resource, not burden—deserving investment enabling contribution</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The choice is clear:</strong></p>
<p>Continue Louisville's trajectory—growing senior population without growing services, isolation epidemic, premature institutionalization, exodus to age-friendly cities—and face senior services crisis as baby boomers age.</p>
<p>Or invest $28M annually to create 500 affordable senior housing units, establish senior centers in every neighborhood, launch door-to-door transit serving 5,000 seniors, eliminate meal waiting lists, and enroll 90% of eligible seniors in benefits—generating $196-252M in economic returns while ensuring every Louisville senior can age with dignity.</p>
<p><strong>This is about basic decency.</strong> After lifetimes building Louisville, paying taxes, raising families, contributing to community, seniors deserve to age in place with security, connection, and dignity. Not poverty, isolation, and institutionalization.</p>
<p><strong>Dave's vision:</strong> A Louisville where every senior has affordable, accessible housing, social connection preventing isolation, transportation enabling independence, comprehensive services supporting aging in place, and economic security ensuring dignity. Where aging is honored, not feared.</p>
<p><strong>An age-friendly Louisville for everyone.</strong></p>
<p>That's democracy that works for everyone. That's the Louisville we'll build together.</p>
